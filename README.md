# Ninetears (9T) / Driade / FFICMUD

This is the source code for the [MUD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MUD) (type
LPMUD) I developed in early 2000's for a couple of years.

At some point there were several dozen people working on it under my supervision,
with several zones available and (back then) many players.

This is the backup I have from those times, which unfortunately is dated _after_ I
left the MUD for other endeavours and someone decided to rename even the file
names to Spanish, thus breaking a long tradition of semi-compatibility between
FR-derived mudlibs.

The original mudlib was FR 3.4, with a few changes from a Spanish mudlib named
Calandria. There are put simply a ton of changes, and the development model back
then didn't sport any sort of revision control, so it is just a **huge** changeset
of **over 1.25 million lines added and about 125k removed in about 28,000
files**.

WOW. It is certainly bound to have some repetition, including some binaries from
those times, but the changeset is just staggering. I am amazed at the work we
did in just 3 years!

On top of that, the FR3.4 mudlib I got to base my work on was some sort of beta
that lacked some things from the final 3.4 release, such as newbie zones and the
likes, so if anyone would be interested, I suggest they look into the diff.

## As Is

The MUD is just stored here for my records, but it is open to anyone's
willingness to use it on their own according to whatever terms the licenses
have. It _should_ be runnable, using a beta (and patched) version of MudOS v22,
embedded in the sources.

I **don't plan to take pull requests** unless they fix some critical condition such
as a crashing game, but I would be happy to know about your progress and, if you
are up to it, link to your derived mudlib or updated base, ie. based on the
latest FR mudlib, and/or FluffOS.

## Thanks

I intentionally left in some player files as credit to people working on this,
mainly in the creators/oldcreators directories. Building and running a MUD was
a very fun experience, made only possible by the many people that helped me
bring it to life.

I only knew most of you by nickname, and only a handful in person, but I am
thankful to you all.
