Half-elves are the perfect blending of the fair Elf peoples, and the more
physically stout human race.  Being of mixed origin does not seem to promote
animosity, and Half-Elves pass freely between Human and Elven cities, living
in the best of both worlds.  Half-elves inherit the Elves virtual immortality,
and the Human trait of getting a task accomplished quickly.  Half elves stand
slightly shorter than their Elven bretheren, and perhaps a little taller than
most humans.  They are physically quite beautiful, and Human men have been
known to follow Half-elven women to the ends of the earth in their suit.
Half-elves also share Elven hatred for Orcs, Goblins, and Drow, but are not so
aloof with other races, since their human side puts them more in touch with
mortal attitudes.

Half-elves share the qualities of elves, in that they are quick and spritely,
However, they are not quite as hardy as their human ancestors.  Half-elves see
as humans, but can percieve more in bright light.  Half-elves excel at magic
use, and some have become renegade and turned their natural skills to 
thievery.
