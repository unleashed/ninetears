Elves are by far the fairest race of all the world.  Tall and slender and pale,
the elf dwells in the forest, speaking to flora and fauna.  Although they can
be killed in battle or withered by disease, the elf is virtually immortal.
None have been able to track an elf's life-span, simply because none have ever
died from natural causes.  They have bright, shining inquisitive eyes, and 
rich, clear voices which are often lifted in song.  Elves have a hatred for 
anything evil, especially Orcs, and their darker Drow cousins.  They also
tend to look down on other races, since their long life makes everyone else
seem in a hurry.  Elves do not count years, but see the seasons pass like
waves in the ocean.

The Elf is quick of mind, and deft in body, making them ideal spell-casters--
something which they are naturally adapted to.  Although limber, the elf is
narrow and thin in frame, making them less durable and physically powerful
than most humans.
