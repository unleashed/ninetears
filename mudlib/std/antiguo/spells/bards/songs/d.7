Armageddon , mighty Armageddon
The Drinker and gamecrasher, as we all know him,
Able to enter Primal Choas on a whim.
Strong as a sheep and mighty as a fly,
Still it takes him forever to die.
Armageddon, Armageddon, What to do with thee?
For all yer drinkin', why do ye not have to pee?
Armageddon, Armageddon, One day ye shall see,
That all drinks here, save Axereaver, taste like thy pee.
