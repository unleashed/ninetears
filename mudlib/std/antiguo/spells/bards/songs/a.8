The Bard Says: This song was taught to me by Case, I can't sing it as well as that silver tongued devil, but I'll do my best:
Life can be real grand & life can be real sweet;
When by fate a true love you might meet.
A man or a woman so kind and so fair;
One whom you think could be oh-so rare.
Gathering courage all throughout the night,
You stroll to their house to start with the plight;
A knock at the door & as it opens slow,
you wonder to yourself, "Oh why did I go?"
Then you see a smile so nice and so pretty,
The most beautiful creature in all of the city
What to do when you are invited right in?
"maybe" you think, "This is a good night to sin!"
The full moon is above and everything is quiet,
whilst in the bed the two of you are having quite a riot!
Nights like this, you don't want them to end;
Cause ye'll be left, afterwards, by yerself to fend!
Two endings there are in a situation like this:
One is when the other might get a bit pissed.
The other has faith, trust, and love oh-so dear,
So as you grow old, you will have kids to rear.
Indeed, love is so wonderful & full of good stuff,
At times it seems hard, like you might not get enough.
Have faith, dear friends--True Love will find you,
And when finally, it does, now you know what to do!
