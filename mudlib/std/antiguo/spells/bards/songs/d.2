Life can be grand and life can be sweet, when by fate a true love you meet,
Someone so kind, and someone so fair, One whom you think could be ever-near!
Gathering the courage and planning the night, You stroll to their home to
start
the plight..
A knock at the door and as it opens so slow, ye think to thyself, 
'why did I go?'
Then you see, smiling so nice and looking so pretty,
The most beautiful creature in all of the city!
What to do when thee are invited right in?
'Maybe' you think, 'tis a night of great sin?'
With the full moon above and the night so quiet
In bed, the two of you are having a RIOT!!!
nights like this, you don't want them to end!
(else ye might be left by thyself to fend?)
Two endings there are, in a situation like this,
One is when the other gets pissed!
The other has faith, trust and love, oh-so-dear!
So as you grow old, ye shall have children to rear!
Indeed, Love is so wonderful and full of great stuff!
At times it seems hard, like you don't get enough.
Have faith dear friends, true love will find you,
And when it finally does, ye'll know what to do!
