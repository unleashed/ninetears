Ah, this is one of the balads of beginnings, stories told to Case by minions of the God Grimbrand
In the beginning, there was only one,
Baldrick was creating a world to be had for all,
While the oceans were almost completely done,
And The New World was to be finished in the fall.
In the depths of the oceans, a small crack arose,
Spewing forth gasses and lava galore.
The odor was horrid--it's emanation tingling the nose,
Noxious, like no smell, ever was before.
The crack grew larger and more monsterous by the minute,
A mountain was forming below in the Sword Sea,
It consumed the water and all things that were in it,
Soon towering over all features, Geographically.
Balaern, as it is known in The Realms today,
The largest of six islands and many centuries old,
Prosperous and thriving, with an extensive bay,
Awaiting its story, which was longing to be told.
