There is a lady sweet and kind, 'twas never a face that so pleased my mind,
I did but see her passing by, and yet I love her, until I die!
Her gesture motion and her smile, her voice, her wit, my heart beguile,
Beguile my heart, I know not why, and yet I love her 'til I die!
The Cupid is winged and doth range her country so my love doth change,
But change the Earth or change the sky, I will still love her, until I die!
hope this one makes you happy...:
Being happy is a state of mind, Tis hard to do all the time,
Many try, but most will fail, They try and try, but to no avail!
Happy is as happy does, Gods always smiling above,
Happy mortls will, indeed, be blessed,
In these realms, though, most are laid to rest,
--Happy fools, rare are they,
--Happy fools, here to stay...
By other mortals, who fear this state, who aren't happy--at any rate!
So be happy, I say, and show all that you care!
Good fortune will come, and much more that is rare...
"Happy mortals will indeed be blessed.."
