The Bard says: A singer named Case taught me this song...

North of Hoerk, in the desert so rare;
A kingdom with magic was ruling there.
The magic, it's said, was kept partly in a Rod;
Much like peas are, when they're insode the pod.
Righteousness ruled across this great land;
A good man was King--little did he demand.
"Fear this Rod!" he said as he showed it to his sons;
"And guard it well, against the evil ones."
His sons numbered two, one younger, one older;
This Rod had awesome power, for the astute beholder.
The King grew old and weary as the years passed;
And he gave the kingdom to his eldest son, at last.
	    &
Oh, that Rod of Wonderous Power and Might;
The Rod of strength and Truth and Light!
Steadfast holding to what is right;
Guiding weary people through the night!
	    &
Greed overcame the new ruler of this region;
Powerful was he, according to his own Legions.
The younger brother, seeing the people distraught;
Approached his father to tell him the lot.
Enraged was the Father, the birth-right was his brother's!
He banished him thence--followed by many others.
	     &
Then came the wars of the brothers, so hideous and manic;
Many people were frightened and some started to panic.
Years passed and the Father finally died;
The youngest brother mourned and cried and cried.
"The Rod!" he thought, "To my brother shall not fall."
Plans were made to get it, if needs be, by a brawl.
	    &
The younger brother's forces attcked with such fury;
It made the older brother and his begin to worry.
"Kill your brother!" people said; "Use The Rod's great power!"
The Eldest brother grabbed the Rod to use, but then began to cower.
The thought of killing his brother that he so dearly loved;
Would indeed, not sit well with God, Baldrick, above.
"I will end this fight, right here and now."
And he wiped the sweat that was forming on his brow.
Amidst the battle, he drew his sword;
The Rod must be destroyed, he gave his word.
The younger brother beheld what the older would do;
He sought The Rod, and that's all he knew.
	  &
The struggle that followed was no ordinary sight;
With The Rod seeming to explode in a Magnificent light!
When the brothers came to their senses and saw the ruins and ashes;
And all the Volcanos that had formed, spewing forth gasses.
Both couldn't believe what the other had done.
Each thought to himself, "I have not won."
For each thought the other had The Rod, it's true;
God Baldrick laughed at the brothers and their little ruse.
Abhoring each other and ignoring their hurt;
Each built a Great Keep far off in the new desert.
Powerful Liches are they now, trying to thwart each other;
Considered great enemies by all, indeed, never brothers.
	 &
Oh, The Wonderous Rod of Power and Might!
Shining still yet in the cool desert night.
A Force of Truth and Hope for all of mankind;
Waiting for to be discovered at the precise time!
	 &
The Bard says: I think Case knew more than he put in that song, but he disappeared into the desert and I haven't seen him since.
