As I went out one evening, from that Daggerford town, 
I met a little Colleen, amongst the heather brown!
"Ah!" says I "perhaps ye're lonely.." She tossed her pretty curl,
"Well maybe I prefer it!" said she, OCH! the dear little girl...
Says I "Perhaps ye're married?" says she "Perhaps I'm not!"
Says I "I'll be thy gossoon!" says she "I'll not be caught!"
"Oh thine eyes are like the ocean and thy Heart is like a pearl!"
Says she "Well then, I'll keep them!" OCH! that dear little girl...
Says I "I've got a cabin, and pigs that number seven...and OH! my dear, for
sure, the place 'twould be like heaven!"
Her eyes looked up in mine and then our hearts were in a whirl!!!
The little pigs had done it!  OCH! that dear little girl...
