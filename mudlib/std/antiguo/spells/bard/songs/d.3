"A Bard?" i hear ye say,..."What in Tymora's name is that?"
Pull up a chair and listen close--and put money in my hat!
Many times in all of my travels, people far and near
Say "'tis only a Bard!"...indeed, they have no fear!
I tell them frankly just what i am, and what a Bard can be,
I tell them in the common tongue, and now I will tell ye:
Bards can sing and play instruments of almost any kind,
In many realms, the name of Minstrel come to mind.
They are known to tell it like it is, or was, or whatever,
Seldom do they stretch the truth, (sarcasm) indeed, not ever!
They sing songs and compose them, from thier own point of view,
Many seem to not be fond of them, that is why they're few.
Some say that they stretch the truth in many of thier songs,
Saying someone did something great, when others knew of it as wrong.
Ye see, Bards just sing and tell all that they might see or hear,
Whatever happens in the Realms, they sing what's pleasing o the ear.
--"A Bard?" I hear ye say, "What in Tymora's name is that?"
--Stand near to me and listne close, throw money in my hat!
A jack-of-all-trades and Master of really none at all,
Often times finding themselves with their back against the wall.
But clever are they, spontaneous, with ingenuity to boot,
Many people think, that in a fight, indeed, they might scoot!
More often than not, they stay throughout all of the poop,
Singing and fighting and boosting moral of all that be in the group!
Should ye see a Bard in the Realms, wandering aimlessly around,
Ye might do well to help them, do not smite them to the ground.
For friendly are they to all people far and wide,
Fighting for what they think as right--on whichever side!
Mischevious and Chaotic are most Bards in Faerun, fair,
Doing whatever it is that they want and not having any care!
--"A Bard?" I hear ye say, "What in Tymora's name is that?"
--Come gather near and listne close, throw money in my hat!
