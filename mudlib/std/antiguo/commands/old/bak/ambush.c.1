/** Ambush.c by Taniwha, with a spot of help from Ilmryn. **/
/** This is a very nasty attack command, designed for the Assassin's guild
    ONLY.  It is made pretty nasty because Assassins are killers, and they 
    are supposed to kill in one shot.  Since we can't do anything that nasty
    here, we decieded on a high damage command that does it's damage with a 
    single attack.  It maybe attempted with any weapon, and the damage is 
    level of the user, divided by 2, times the damage roll of the weapon 
    , and all of this randomized.  The damage multiplier stops going up at
    level 20, for a max multiplier of 10.  While testing it at level 10 the
    damage ranged from 15-30, and at level 30 the damage was around 50.  This
    was ALL well below the damage capable of being done by a wizard of equal
    or lower level.  Also of note is the fact that if the user is listed in
    the attacking list then they suffer damage.  Even if they have stopped,
    but are being hunted by a monster or character for 3 screens ago, they
    get damaged, and obviously fail the ambush.  This should be more than
    adequate balancing for the capabilities of this command.  ****/
