17/1/94 Taniwha. Altered backstab to lock it out for (40HB) after logon and previous use
      Reason: Abuse, players attemptiing backstab, quiting and logging back on if they failed.
17/1/94 Taniwha. Altered go_berserk() , checked for min con before adjusting
   at end of berserk, altered query_property() test to query_property_exists()
   Reason: Players dying. I THINK the property was running down to 0 and
      the con adjust was being done several times.

18/1/94: Taniwha. Altered go_berserk() to prevent berserking if con < 6
   Reason: as above... prevent stupidity.

19/1/95: Taniwha, added 40HB lockout to Ambush
          reason: As for backstab
           added 10 HB + berserk time lockout to Berseerk
   reson. Prevention of suicides :)

22/1/95 Taniwha: Created tweaks.h with HB lockouts (and eventually) GP costs
   reason: to speed up maintenance of this stuff

9/2/95 Taniwha: Added Slice for Drow Warriors
11/2/95  Taniwha: Dropped cost of Slice to 5GP flat

12/2/95 Taniwha: Altered steal
    so ghosts can't (Rather Grimbrand did)
   3/95 Taniwha: Max gp cost of ambush now 50, since it stops getting better 
         at about this level.
06/04/95 Taniwha Ambush
   Was doing twice the damage it should.
