   New weapon Logic by Sojan.  Designed to implement weapons in a such a way
   to make combat/weapons design as close as possible to the way it is
   implemented in the Rolemaster FRPG system.  Hopefully it should be
   easily modifiable to any other FRPG system as well.

   * Baldrick here, tuned it so that it works witth the new FR lib.

/* AD&D rules:

   Base dice: 20
   The point is to hit a better AC then the opponents
   the hitter has a figure calle THAC0 (to hit AC 0). you throw the dice
   and the result is calculated this way:

   THAC0 - dice = AC to hit.

   This is the basic rule.
   the thac0 is based on levels and class. maybe we could calculate the AC hit
   i some other way, more close to what is done on DS. find

   Baldrick.

   Aug '95: chaned the basic AC/thaco from base-10/20 to base 100/200.
   Baldrick.

   brief explanation,
   weapon_type - the table the weapon is to look on for its damage results
   weapon_skill - The skill used to attack with the weapon
   nm_bonus - the normal combat bonus of the weapon (if any)
   m_bonus - the magical combat bonus of the weapon, at times this may
             be the only bonus availible to the wielder (when facing
             magical monsters for example)

        Either bonus may be used but they are not cumalative - normally the
        highest bonus will be used.
   fn_code  - the function called when an attack takes place.  This can be
              used to add extra or unusual effects in that are not catered
              for in the standard weapon code.
