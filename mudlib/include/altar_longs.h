#define ALTAR_CYRCIA \
"     The altar radiates hatred and evil.  Waves of emotion crash against "\
"you driving you to your knees.  It is made from the blackest of obsidian "\
"and seems to absorb all light.  The top of the altar is bowl shaped with "\
"a hole in the center.  Large scratches line the inside of the bowl as if "\
"many objects, large and small, have scarred it's surface.  You also notice "\
"the sickly sweet smell of dried blood.\n"

#define ALTAR_HOKEMJ \
"     Gnarled roots rise from the ground twisting together in a jumbled "\
"mass of wood to create an altar to Hokemj.  The branches and roots shift "\
"and move constantly, giving you the impression that the altar is very "\
"much alive.  The top of the altar remains flat and smooth even though "\
"the rest shifts constantly.\n"

#define ALTAR_RADIX \
"     This is a large mass of stones and wood forming a roughly oval "\
"block in honor of Radix, god of Confusion.  The stone is a peculiar "\
"mixture of obsidian and ivory criss-crossing without rhyme or reason.  "\
"Roots and branches of long dead trees twist through the mass of rocks "\
"creating small holes and gaps where water trickles through in endless "\
"streams.\n"

#define ALTAR_GRIMBRAND \
"     You see a large pentagram shaped stone, opaque and dark.  The top "\
"of the altar is perfectly smooth and tapers into the middle.  It is "\
"supported by the huge pewter statue of a siberian tiger with inlaid "\
"stripes of black onyx.  Upon closer inspection of the stone top, you can "\
"faintly see a myriad of agonized faces contorted in pain and despair; "\
"souls, trapped and forever searching but always knowing they cannot "\
"escape.\n"

#define ALTAR_RAISA \
"     This altar is octagonal in shape and is roughly hewn from the "\
"purest of white marble.  Light emanates from the stone and the whole "\
"room thrums with it's power.  The top of the altar is smooth and "\
"polished to resemble a mirror, reflecting all light.  You notice that "\
"it is not your visage that you can see in the altar, but your soul.  "\
"Everything you do and everything you are can be seen in your reflection.\n"

#define ALTAR_TIMION \
"     This altar does not resemble any altar you have ever seen.  It "\
"looks more like the bench of a judge with a huge throne set behind it.  "\
"The large bench is made of the best oak from the Crylian Forests of "\
"Oceanfall.  Hard, cold and seemingly impartial, it is the perfect "\
"physical representation of the logic and order that Timion, god of "\
"Justice, uses in judgement of all mortals.\n"

#define ALTAR_DUCKY \
"     The heat of hatred blasts your senses like a furnace.  Before you "\
"stands a large stone altar, black and foreboding.  Rivers of molten "\
"magma lie just beneath the nearly opaque surface giving off an eerie red "\
"glow.  It looks almost like the claw of some large demon is holding the "\
"altar in its upraised palm.  Smooth and perfectly round, the altar is "\
"open at the top much like a cauldron and it is filled with boiling magma.\n"

#define ALTAR_TANIWHA \
"     The altar is the hollowed out trunk of a giant cedar tree.  The "\
"center has been worn smooth through countless centuries of gifts to "\
"Taniwha, god of Life and Light.  Worn bark covers the trunk with "\
"gnarled roots fanning out in all directions.  Carved into the very "\
"heart of the altar is a large image of the sun with the rays of light "\
"reaching out in all directions to the edges of the top of the trunk.\n"

#define ALTAR_BALDRICK \
"     The altar is a huge hexagon of grey slate: smooth on the top with "\
"rough sides tapering to a single point at the very base.  Perfectly "\
"balanced, the altar looks as though the least amount of force will knock "\
"it over.  Curious, you give it a gentle push and you're suprised to find "\
"that it does not move.  The stone of the altar is very hard.  You get "\
"the impression that -nothing- could move it from this spot.\n"

#define ALTAR_NONE "If you are seeing this, report it as a bug.\n"
