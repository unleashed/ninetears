documentation for using move_around.c

this function is for moving monsters randomly about an area so that they
are not always loading in the same places.  very helpful for quest monsters
so that the quests are a little different each time.

description of parameters:

move_around(string monsie, int num_in_group, int groups, 
    string *rooms, string *env)

monsie: path to the monster to be moved around

num_in_group: number of these monsters in each group of the monsters

groups: total number of groups of these monsters

*rooms: an array of the paths to the rooms that the monster groups could
        be moved to

*env: the path of the area that monsters are located in (this might
     become an array someday so that 1 move_around could control an
     entire domain *shiver*)
^^^^ it became an array *really shiver*

requirements:

- the area that uses this to control its monsters needs to have a
  baseroom

to use:

- in the most frequently entered room of an area do the following:

1. in a mask of reset call move_around passing the appropriate
   parameters

- in the baseroom:

1. in the create() mask place load_object("path_of_most_traveled_room")
   this makes sure that the the room with the monster mover will always be
   loaded whenever anyone enters any room of the area (therefore the monster
   mover code doesnt _need_ to be in the most traveled room...its not in 
   baseroom because i have the feeling bad things _could_ happen if was
   placed there)



now you are ready to use move_around.. for an example see mv_arnd_ex.c in
this directory.
