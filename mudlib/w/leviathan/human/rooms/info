   "Welcome to your guild!  Here, you can advance for free once you "
   "obtain the required experience at each level up to level five.  "
   "Once reaching level five, you can no longer advance here and "
   "will have to find another place in the realms to join.  \n"
   "\nAdvancing to your first level requires no experience points.  "
   "All you have to do is type \"advance\" and you will be level "
   "one.  You should consider using the \"rearrange\" command "
   "before doing do however.  When you advance, your stat rolls are "
   "based on your current stats.  So, if your stats reflect the "
   "high strength and dexterity of fighters, you will get fighter "
   "rolls.  Likewise, if you resemble a wizard, you will get a "
   "different set rolls.  Note however, there is no long term "
   "advantage to your stats gained here, after time, they will "
   "approach the average for your final guild which you are required "
   "to choose advance past level six.  "
