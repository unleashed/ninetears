The different lock types are:
bolt, catch, comb, cmplx, hid, magic, vary, tumb, tumb2, and l_pin.

How To Make An Exit Locked:

add_exit("parlor","/w/dyno/parlor.c","door");
door_lock("parlor","l_pin",65);

This sets up an exit from a room to Dyno's Parlor with a door type.
Then door_lock(exitname, locktype, difficulty); sets the exit up as a 
locked door which will need a lockpick of the 'l_pin' type in order to 
pick the lock.  The '65' is the difficulty of picking the lock 
successfully.  The range for difficulty is from '1' to '100', so pick a
number based on the value of the reward behind the door to be fair.

Any other questions please mail me. =) Dyno

NOTE:  Thanes please check before you put picks into play.
No need to flood the Realms with 3 types of 'tumb' lockpicks etc.
Thanks!
