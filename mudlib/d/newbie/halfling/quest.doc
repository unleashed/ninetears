Newbie Halfling Quest info:

     quest 1:  Getting armour/weapons-
To get the goodies, you have to look around in the forest to the north of the city. 
In room half27.c, is where you search.  The bartender will tell a player 
to watch out for a rock in a forest area.  That's part of the desc
of the room, as well.  A simple search will reveal the equipment.

     quest 2:  Exiting the area-
To leave this area, you must find 2 items.  The first is a gem.  The second
is a staff.  An end boss guards both items.  The gem is located in pit2, 
and is guarded by a sandlion (sandlion.c).  The staff is in the inventory
of an NPC called a blood skeleton (endboss.c).  The halfling has to be level 
five before they can enter the room and fight the skeleton.  After
acquiring both items, you take them to the temple and lay them before
the statue of raisa by 'kneeling' to the statue (kneel statue or kneel before
statue both work).  If the player is less than level 5, they won't be 
able to transport off the island.

     general notes-
OK, this area is probably one of the smaller, easiest areas there is.  
The NPCs are extremely tough without the chainmail or bastard sword.  When
a player gets a hold of those weapons, they'll hit level 5 in about 3 hours.
