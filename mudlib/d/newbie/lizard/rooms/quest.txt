To whom it may concern, The lizard area has the following quest in
it. The newbie will be rtequired to acquire The amulet of the K'Laktaar
An aincent race of Lizard-Man Warriors that fought as well in water as 
they did on land. When the newbie gets the Amulet they will learn the skill 
of swimming and underwater breathing. To get out of the newbie area they will
have to go through a series of underwater rooms and if they do not have the amulet 
they may not enter the rooms. In the underwater rooms there will be one room with the
skeleton of the War Lord of the K'Laktaar (MirShaan) with a Chainmail and some 
kind of weapon, aint decided what yet. I'll prob let the bartender or some one like that tell them to go see the priest Shankaree which will send them to kill a 
golem and bring back some proof ie (a claw) and the priest will give them the 
Amulet of the K'Laktaar.
