OK .... here is the scoop on the lizard area.
For the most part, rooms 01-23 are simply a swampy
area with thick foilage, vines and moss hanging down from the
trees, water, bad smell, mist and fog(poor vision), and strange
noises.  There will be monsies here ...Someone wanted a place
to put a hungry vine ... well this is it.  These rooms are
surrounding a body of water(lagoon or bog.... whatever) and
I want rooms 12 & 13 to be a large log that sticks out into the
water.  Rooms 24-27 are the village .... there will be more
rooms there.
The pond or shatever in the center will be swimable after the
player learns how to swim (quest) ..... there will be some underwater
rooms as well.
There will be more quest items under the water .... add any good ideas
that you might have here, or put them on the board.
Oh ... yes, the Ts on the map are for the town  8-)
More info to come....  8-)
