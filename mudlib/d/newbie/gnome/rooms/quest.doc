This document is the proposed solutions to the quests in the 
newbie area for the newbie/gnomes.

EXIT QUEST:
   1. Pick the white rose.  This rose can be found in newbie/gnome10.
   2. This flower must be give to Makayla.  She is found in 
      the center of town (newbie/gnome14).  Ath this point, MaKayla
      will give the player a coil of rope and a small worn
      piece of paper.
   3. The player must the study the paper.  Going through this
      step, the player will then learn to tie a clovehitch which 
      will add a rope skill and eventually allow him/her to 
      descend into a black hole.
   4. To descend into this hole (found in under20), the playes must 
      tie the rope to a column in the room and perform a related
      verb noun command such as 'descend hole'.  Once entering this 
      hole, the player will then see a ladder and by knowing where 
      this ladder is will not have to tie another rope again.
   5. Once in the hole, there is a tunnel leading south.  At the
      end of this tunnel, Aldinanachru will be standing (room05).
      This room will be the exiting point from Macedonia.  For
      him to allow you through the gate, the player must give him 
      the Greystone of Reorx.
   6. To find this stone, there are two unobvious exits.
      a. In newbie/gnome17 there is a hole in the cliff.  In this room
         the players must 'enter cliff'.
      b. Once into the tunnels, there is a room (under10) where 
         the player must 'climb rubble'.
      After this, the Greystone is nearby and easy to find.
      *note: to be able to get the stone, the player but be 
             level 4 of higher.
At the completion of the quest, the player will be given an
Amulet of Aldinanachru and be placed into the realms never 
to return to Macedonia.
