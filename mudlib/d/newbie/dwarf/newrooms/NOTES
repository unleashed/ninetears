I need to place a message on the guild board telling players to look
around a little.

I need to have some good hints to direct players to the waterfall area.

Perhaps an adventurer walking around soaking wet or something

Hmmmm how to put the players back in the room they were in
before the changes ... some of the room names will change ..ACK!
