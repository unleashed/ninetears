Just a reminder to myself on ideas that I have for this area.

I want a couple of easy quests in this area ....
one is about the deranged smithy
the other is to get out



Ideas for getting out---
Radix has said that there will soon be a skills element for 
several skills that a player can learn.
I want to have a rope using skill that they can learn the 
most basic uses of here in the newbie area.
The rope skill can make the player stay until they get to a 
certain level.  I want to keep them here until about level 4
or 5
I am gonna make a nice little hermit that will teach you
I may have the player bring him food or help him in some other 
way ... hmmmm..... any suggestions???

When leaving I have an idea on hoe to get them to a town  8-)
use a series of call_out()s after they begin to climb down
the rope.
---You begin your decent down the mountain, slowly you 
move hand over hand down the rope.
---You are now a long ways down the mountain (30ft)
---Suddenly your lack of experience causes you to lose your 
footing, your hands tremble as you lose your hold on the rope 
and fall...
--- You flip head over heals down the remainder of the 
mountain until you finally hit the bottom with a resounding
THUD!!
---- You try to raise up but the effort causes you to black
out.
---You wake up later (wonder how long?) and fell that you are
moving....You lok around and see that you are in the back of
a hay filled wagon.  The wagon is moving and the motion makes 
you feel dizzy
----You pass out again.
-----You wake up later in the hospital or a tavern or something

I am told that there is a car coded .... it would be cool to have the 
other players see this player ride in on the wagon going to the 
hospital or wherever


The blind bat tavern is almost finished ....
The bartender is cool
If he is attacked, I want him to grab a winged war-hammer from
behind the bar and use it to attack with.
A winged war-hammer can be thrown at the attacker and I also 
want him to throw it and have it disappear into extra-dimenensional
space where the player cannot get to it   8-)
how rude!!
