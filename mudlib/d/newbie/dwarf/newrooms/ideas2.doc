This involves the possibility that there will be no "Newbies only"
areas in the mud.  
If this happens then I will need to add some entrance into the mines
that players can get into:
     1)  Enter a small cave and slide down a tunnel that they can't
         Climb back up.
     2)  Fall into a pit that leads into the area.
     3)  Attack an NPC that throws you into a pit.
     4)  Make some sort of quest that leads them to it.
     5)  .........

I don't want the players to be able to get out the way they came in.
They will have to complete the rope skills quest to get out.


The mining thing.
The players need to go through some mining process to collect ore
that they need to make their weapons.  Then they take the ore to a 
smithy where they can rent the forge and tools to make their weapon.
Also, it should cost XP.  The players can make their weapons better
when they collect more ore.  The amount of XP should be based on the
amount of ore that is being used and the level and maybe even some
stat of the player (INT?).  
The actual mining should be very difficult.
The ore should be hard to find and hard to mine.  Is there any way
to have ore appear randomly in a few rooms?  It would be pointless to
have the ore in the same few rooms every time .... the players will figure
out where it is and go to it every time.  They will need a pick (which
we will gladly sell to them at a fair price)   8-)
I will come up with something cool that will reveal where ore is hidden
that the players will have to do every time.  Once again, pointless to
have the stuff out in the open.  After revealing it, players must use
the pick a random number of times to get the ore.  Amount collected
will depend on number of swings needed to dislodge it.

I also want to implement a tip glass in the bar.  Leave a tip, and there
is a chance that the bartender will give some hint to a quest located
in the mines.  Code should not be too hard for that.  8-)
Oh .... just to be precise ... gotta make sure the bartender is present before
he can talk  *GRIN*


MORE TO COME!!

Here is the plan:  I am making a bucket to be sold in the shop ... with this
players can get water and throw it on the walls in the mines ..... if ore is 
present, the water will reveal it .... then the player must use the pick to
"mine ore" ...... it will take a random number (2-5) of swings to dislodge
the ore ..... the player must get a bucket from down here (fix it so that
other buckets will leak) and a pick from here as well ..... I have a quest in
mind to help the players learn how to mine the ore.  I have indicated that
the smithy has gotten sick and gone mad .... the assistant in the smithy shop
will ask for help in finding Darklor (the smithy) and giving him some herbs
or some other form of medicine to make him well again .... he will then tell
you how to locate and mine ore and he will tell you how to light the forge in
the smithy shop.  When the forge is lit the player will be able to forge a 
weapon from the ore.
