				The Dwarf Newbie Quests.



There are two quests in the dwarf newbie area.
The first one is the equipment quest.
In order for the player to solve this quest he must do the following things:
A. He must 1st listen to the shop keeper that talks of his lost boss.

The store manager speaks of the moss and of his boss at this time.
Next the player must find the correct color moss which is in the caverns.
After finding the moss(blue) he takes it to Darklor the missing blacksmith.
Upon giving the moss to darklor he is rewarded with a dwarf chainmail 
and 2000 exp.

Quest 2:

The second quest is the exit of the area quest.

The player must find the bread which is on one of the cave rats wandering
around the area.  Upon finding the bread he takes it to the hermit which
is located at the south end of the waterfall.  Once he gives the bread
to the hermit, he is shown how to tie knots.
The next step is to buy a rope and proceed to the exit.
Once he is on the ledge the player must type "tie rope to rock"
sometimes this does not always happen on the 1st try.  I suggest having 
the player drop the rope and then trying to tie it again. Once he 
ties the rope to the rock he must type "climb rope" or "climb down."

This will allow him to climb down the rope and begin his adventures in the
city of Daggerford.
