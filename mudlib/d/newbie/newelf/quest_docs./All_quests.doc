//real mud without killing anything but spiders, forlarren, 
//and imps. (for the toughest mudders only.)
//2) Old_Man/Woman.

//woman to get xp.
//3) Eldevan. You gotta go get Shirein's pendant(uncoded)
//from Llyr (The evil bard.) And give it to Eldevan.
//(it will also give a +1 dex bonus if you wear one(people usuallly wont get two of them.))
//4) Weapon. There will be a hidden room in the Inn that has a 
//top grade weapon in it (for newbie of course.).
//5) And Finally, Treetop Leaf. A magical leaf in treetops that you can
