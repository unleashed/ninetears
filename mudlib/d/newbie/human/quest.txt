The quest to leave the newbie area:

   Because the newbie area is on an island, the players have to collect items
to build a raft to escape.
They need to find:
      2 casks from rooms/v07.c
      1 door from rooms/v06.c
      1 vine from rooms/h00.c
They also need to find:
      baccy from the pirate captain in rooms/p01.c
      axe from rooms/g00.c to cut the vine.

When they have these items, they take them to Pirate Dan at rooms/b06.c and
he helps them to build the raft and he sails it for them.
They land on /d/hoerk/belaern/s_jung/city/beach/beach02.c


With the aid of the vine they can also get a chainmail and longsword from
a ledge rooms/pit.c
All they have to do is get a vine, and type "climb" on j37.c
