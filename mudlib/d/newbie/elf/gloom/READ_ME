Hi, the rooms with dfo before it, are my gloomy forest area...
the foes are wood imps, and the goal is to get to the heart of the gloomy
forest and kill the evil that is there...

it is laid out in a 5 by 5 diamon....with the numbers increases as you go northeast and the letters increasing as you go northwest
the heart would be where 4d is, put instead is dfoheart...room 3b say, would be dfo3b in my notation.

any questions, ask me.
