Ok. included in this directory...
are :
base_command.c courtesy of flode, taniwha and myself.
inheriting target.c.

a good number of these initial commands use it so you can see by example how to convert those that aren't.

a point to keep in mind. the commands already converted use new_tweaks.h while those not converted use tweaks.h. look it over and you'll see what I mean.

yes eventually new_tweaks.h should become tweaks.h.

hrm whatelse.
oh yes. when calling end_hb_command use a call_out as the current /std/living/spells.c will puke if you don't call_out, look for a change in that in future releases.

any questions, just drop in by FR PRIME and ask.
