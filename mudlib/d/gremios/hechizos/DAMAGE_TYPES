// Cailet 1998 -- Updating docs.  Add Resists with timed_properties
   now... i.e. add_timed_property("air",1,5000000);

Legal Damage Types for Spells
 -when added as a property do as such...
        add_property("type",value)
      
    type -> MUST be in all lower case and spelled exactly as below
    value -> Number between 1-100, this is the percent of damage 
             that is RESISTED.  So a value of 50 means the target
             takes 50% damage from that type.
             negative numbers will give a weakness to the person.
             a negative 100 would mean double damage to the target.

  to damage the target.
