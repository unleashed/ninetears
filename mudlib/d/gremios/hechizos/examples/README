All spells for wizards, clerics etc shoulc be in their own directory.
"tweaks.h" is a file used to make simple adjustments to spells for
baancing purposes.  Each directory should have its own.  
"useful_stuff.c" is a collection of useful functions called by some
spells, I'm not sure if I included any here or not, but you can see
what they might be good for.  Cleric and Wizard spells are mixed
up in this directory, and the tweaks.h is from the wizard dir,
but it is simple to see where the file should be changed at the
top to reside in a cleric (or whatever spellcaster) directory.
The types of spells included for examples:
Simple mage/cleric spells: Bless and Light and Min. Air Resist.
Spells that use shadows: Pacify and Spirit Armour
Symbol Transformation: For clerics, I included the Timion example.
