A serenade:
Lovely Maiden, hear me true, 'neath thy lattice hither,
My poor heart knows only rue--As I play my Zither!
Tho' the guarding convent wall, strong protection render,
Still my songs beseeching fall, in thy silence tender!
When the evening sun has set, and the shadows falling,
I climb o'er the garden wall, to thy vine bow'r calling!
Come oh fairest, sweetest one, Answer to my singing,
Come, oh dearest,, to my Arms, to thy true love winging!
