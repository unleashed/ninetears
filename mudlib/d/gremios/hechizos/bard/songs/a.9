		 "Goodbye"
	Goodbye is not an ending, when you know that people care,
	For miles may come between you, but warm thoughts are always there.
	Goodbye is not an ending, but a different start for you,
	A time for making brand new friends and seeing dreams come true.
So out there on the road of life, you look back and you will find,
That this part of your life will always shine.
	Goodbye is not an ending, when you know that people care,
	For miles may come between you, but warm thoughts are always there.
	Goodbye is not an ending, but a different start for you,
	A time for making brand new friends and seeing dreams come true.
Good bye is not an ending, for you'll find along life's way,
Within your heart you'll always have a song of yesterday,
Good bye is not an ending, but a start of something new,
A beginning and a starting of a whole new part of you.
So remember all the good you've done in changing people's lives,
And this part of your life will always shine.
Yes, remember all the good you've done in changing people's lives,
And this part of your love will always shine.
	Goodbye is not an ending, when you know that people care,
	For miles may come between you, but warm thoughts are always there.
	Goodbye is not an ending, but a different start for you,
	A time for making brand new friends and seeing dreams come true.
