If you've got a problem, I don't care what it is
If you need a hand I can assure you this
I can help; I've got two strong arms, I can help
It would sure do me good to do you good; let me help
When I go to sleep at night, you're always a part of my dream
Holding me tight and telling me
Everything I want to hear
Don't forget me baby
All you got to do is call
You know how I feel about you
If I can do anything at all, let me help
If your child needs a daddy, I can help
It would sure do me good to do you good; let me help
