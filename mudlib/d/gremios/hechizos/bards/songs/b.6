I once had a sword, or should I say, it once had me
I picked it up, oh what a sword, it was plus three
Its Ego was 12, a fact of which I wasn't aware
Then I tried to leave and found that the sword didn't care
Ohhhhhhhhhhh
I walked through the halls, wasting my time, nothing to find
Then I turned a corner, and then I said, Oh No !, UNDEAD !
The thirty-two wights saw me coming and started to laugh
And I closed my eyes as my sword started hewing a path
And when I awoke, I was alone, that sword it had flown
Now I use a club, isn't it good
No-ego wood
