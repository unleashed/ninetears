I'll buy you a diamond ring, my friend
If it makes you feel all right
I'll get you anything my friend
If it makes you feel all right
For I don't care too much for money,
For money can't buy me love
I'll give you all I've got to give
If you say you love me too
I may not have a lot to give
But what I've got I'll give to you
For I don't care too much for money,
For money can't buy me love
Can't buy me love.....
Everybody tells me so...
Can't buy me l o v e ....
