Let me tell you a tale of Old
When a desert king ruled this land of dark gold
Rugerio the Ruthless was his name
Or so he was called by his enemy thanes
Some say he ruled with a gentle hand for
he school every child, woman and man
Time went on and Christina came 
there meeting was destined for fame
And he took her for his wife
She accepted, there was no strife
Their family grew and was blessed by the Gods
they had sons numbering two
One born with the wisdom of an Owl
The other with a heart so pure he 
could detect anything foul
Now Rugerio and Christina are no more
Zhukov the travler knows the true score
A mad man swims the desert looking for 
a back way into the front door.
A treasure awaits the man who knows
what is longed after by 
Once two friends now turned foes
