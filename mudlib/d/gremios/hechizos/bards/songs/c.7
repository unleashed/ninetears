Once upon a time, long, long ago, Most things here in harmony did flow.
But like in everything, disruption would be had,
But still yet, good always was balanced with the bad.
The olden days, very few can recall them,
The olden days are here no more, they are fallen.
As the new world awakes, and the old is forgotten,
I sing to you songs of the good and the rotten!
The Bergen Cartel, seems to seep into my mind,
A more havoc-reaping group in the Realms, you could not find.
Consisting of three very mischevious friends
That adventured everywhere and put all opposers to their end!
The mighty Antago, Lagg and Slinger,
Mess with them, man, and ye'll be put through the wringer!
The good and the bad priests of the old realms,
Tymora, Tempus, Lloth, Bane, and others, like Helm.
Mostly good in Nature, and helping all kinds,
trusting in their Gods, on all quests and finds.
Camille, Axesplitter, Bluerider and Kk,
Imagine the Realms if they were here today!
The Fighters of old were a fearsome lot,
Devastating all against them when they fought.
A few are remembered as heros and such,
From them it was found ye could learn very much.
Cerrus and Skurge, Ambrose and Lorad,
Ariana, the nice, and Drunsen, then a drunk _little_ lad.
As the new world awakes and the old is forgotten,
I sing to ye this song of the good and the rotten.
Singing a song that feels, to me, oh-so real.
Perchance because, I was there to see and to feel!
There were mages and wizards, powerful and mighty,
Insults to any of them weren't taken lightly.
Burning, Exploding and destroying many things,
Power had they, to kill by most all means!
Mages like Blackstaff, Arkhan and Draith,
Deathknight and the grandfather to all, Ironmage.
A rather quiet guild in these realms was there,
One that some thought that they shouldn't fear.
Indeed, the Assassins, were a stealthy little bunch,
Killing silently and quickly, they made many people their lunch.
The great Shadowblade, Bonecrusher, Arax, and Azafar--the Ace,
Demifille, Moonlight, Rollin and Case.
Now, of thieves, there were many, ruthless and vile,
Some had a short stay, others a long while.
Two of the best, indeed, come to my mind,
Two greater thieves in the Realms ye could not find.
Heretic and Supertony, they lived with such grace,
Robbing and killing and pillaging alkl over the place.
Content, if ye find them, these people asre today,
Helpful and playful to all in their way.
A few of these Legends, in these Final Realms still roam,
For they know that, indeed, there is no place like home.
Yes, the olden days, very few can recall them,
The olden days are here no more, they be almost forgotten.
FEESH!
