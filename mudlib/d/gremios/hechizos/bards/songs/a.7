A dragon and a bard met one summers day.
To pass says the dragon "you will have to pay."
The bard he sings a song, alas it was a long one.
A ballad of two brothers, battling in the sun.
The dragon, he got hungry and wolfed the bard straight down
(around the 13th stanza is what rumour says)
So young bards, this lesson learn ye well...
Let your songs not be boring
Lest dragons drag ye down.
