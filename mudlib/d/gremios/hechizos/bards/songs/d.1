For honor for justice, for truth and for right!
Fight with these, mighty people, with of thy might!
For courage for hope, for happiness and for love!
Indeed!  These qualities are of the great Gods above!
For compassion and forgiveness, for loyalty and kindness!
Have all these in thy soul, and indeed thou shall find bliss!
Yes qualities like these, are indeed, seldom found,
not high, nor low, not in trees, nor the ground!
Few possess such a code as this, and fight against evil--who at them, will
hiss!
Strengths likeunto the Gods, they seem to possess,
To all, it might seem that they are the best!
They stand for what is just and beauteous and right!
Standing proud and tall, they're the warriors of light...
