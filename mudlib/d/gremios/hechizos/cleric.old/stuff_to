I've updated all the cause spells to use a 'to-hit' check.
Flamestrike is updated.
Cure spells done.

Still need to do raise/res, know_align.
Work out bugs in mag_vestment.
Wait on new functions (tmp adjustment stuff) for Bless/Prayer,
  and simliar type spells.
Get some more offensive spells, Harm, Earthquake, lower level ones
  as well.
Make Cause spells and Harm, have a negative effect on the alignment.
