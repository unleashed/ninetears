for scout:
inherit "/obj/chars/scout.c"
in setup
set_name, set_short, set_long
defaults to fighter probably best as is.
set_race

load_a_chat if necessary
no load_chat if expect to be hidden

set_sneaky() no args if you wish to be hidden and/or sneaking
(must give it a set move after if you want it to sneak around ;)

set_my_friends(org,name) eg ("race_group","House of T'heron")
use either "race_group","group", or "guild"
name is what is returned by query_group_name query_race_group_name etc

set_watch_list("race",({races})) eg ("race",({"elf","dwarf","human"}))
don't change the first argument "race"

so... don't set level, stats, aggressive, gps, hps or wimpy

giving add attack spells might be a bad idea too.
