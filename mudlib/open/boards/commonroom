Title: '/releasefiles'

Okay..I -think- you want /releasefiles to be the dir we use when
we crate this thing up and ship it?
Does secure.not tie into this as well?  Someone please keep me
posted on these things.  =)

Title: 'Dir Structure'

I need to have someone help me look at the dir structure here.
I'm getting into a "I want to trim the fat off this place" mood
and I don't want to go around arbitrarily deleting directories
and finding out I needed them later.  The ones I'd -like- to
target are the dirs that are for the 'old mud' -- The -Original-
FR.  Seems like a lot of that old stuff is loitering around
Also seem to be a few questionable dirs that are mirrored between
/std and /global.  Plus I'm really not sure what /secure.not 's
point is.

Any help would be especially....
helpful?

Title: 'FR: Illumitech'

Well, here it is.
First, I'd like to thank Baldrick for making this all possible.
Now its just a question of making this place -functional- before
we tear it all to pieces and make it a better, more stable, happier
place.

some things that aren't working:
Finger
Rooms (there seem to be a few references to /d/daggerford)
And many fun and exciting random driver crashes!

Anyway...Until I get some folk in here who Really Know What They're
Doing, I'm going to go through the dirs and try to wipe out as many
Final Realms references as possible...And take note of Where They Are...
Since (if we're making a lib to be easily portable) we'll want to set
a variable found in the config.frlib file to take care of it.

Title: 'New things...'

There are still issues with logging in and character generation.
'help' is broken, sometimes causes the mud to crash.
'Say' is fixed.  (Who the -HELL- is /w/george--and WHY does
	FR point to his directory?)
Via the wonders of 'grep' and 'sar' I've changed -most- of the
	instances of "Final Realms Mud" (and all variants) to be
	FR: Illumitech.  We really should consider making this a
	variable--if we're going to make the lib friendly.

That's all I've tinkered with thus far.

Title: '/baseobs'

You might be better qualified to say what's a FR baseob.
Some of the dirs in /baseobs also seem to be mirrored in /std
I went through and rm'd the -obvious-.  I'd like you to check though.
Thanks.
Me.

Title: 'Ok..'


What has to be done before benedick starts.. :=)

1: never change to FR: blabla, use mud_name() instead.
  there should also be a mud_long_name() whis is typical for the who.
  (if it's not here now, I'll fix that)

2: remove all FR-only /baseobs and spells.

3: start telliong people we exist. 

do NOT start on 3 before 2 is done.

finger works, ls -ls is somewhat broken.

and BTW, do 2 first.. I have to release this as 3.4 asap.
