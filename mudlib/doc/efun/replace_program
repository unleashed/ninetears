Usage: replace_program("pathtoinheritedfile")

You can use this in rooms that inherit a common base file and have NO
functions other than setup() defined.

This allows the driver to re-use the program code from "pathtoinheritedfile"
rather than loading another copy into memory.

example

inherit "/std/outside.c";

void setup()
{
   set_long("blahdy blah blah\n");
   add_clone(CHARS+"npc",3);
   add_exit("south",HELL,"plain");
   replace_program("/std/outside");
}
