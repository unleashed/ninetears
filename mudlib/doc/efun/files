any *files(string str)

Returns an array containing files specified by regular expression str.
Should understand '*', '?', '..' and '.'
Caveat: if you pass it an exact pattern (eg "myfile.c") it will not
return anything. This is present in 3.0.41, at least. It may be fixed
later.\

Returns 0 if no match.
