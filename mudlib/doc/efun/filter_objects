filter_objects

mixed *filter_objects(mixed *arr, string fun, object ob, mixed extra)

Returns an array holding the items of arr filtered through ob->fun(). The
function fun in ob is called for each element in arr with that element as
parameter. A second parameter extra is sent in each call if given. If 
ob->fun(arr[.index.], extra) returns 1 the element is included in the 
returned array.

If arr is not an array, then 0 will be returned.
