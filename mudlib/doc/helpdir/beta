            ** Final Realms Betatest period Phase Two **

  This Mud aren't bugfree, just as every other Mud. But we are trying to make it bugfree.

  You can all help us fixing this. Use the BUG command to tell us about exits not working, monsters behaving strange and similar stuff. Use the IDEA command if you have any better ideas, and PRAISE if you like what you see.

  Please don't tell the creators about the bugs, be sure they know about most of them (by reading the BUG log) and be told from every creature on the mud won't help much ....:=)

  On the behalf of all Builders, Patrons and Demi Gods. 

  Baldrick the God. 

type 'help betatest' for an explanation on why we have a Phase Two.
