Usage : kill <thing>

Kill is the command used to initiate combat with monsters and other players.
Once combat has started, you will hit the monsters automatically and be able
to use commands and spells given to you by your guild.  If a monster starts a
fight with you, there is probably little you can do other than kill it or run
for your life.
