Pinkfish's soul.

How to use (What can it do for you?):
        The feeling or atmosphere commands that you use, like smile and so
on come from your soul.  The soul used on this mud is different to most
others you will have come across.  Below are a few examples of what you
can do with this soul.

> smile happilly at furball
You smile happily at furball.
> smile w at furball
You smile wryly at furball
> shake hands with furball
You shake hands with furball
> shake hands furball
You shake hands with furball.

The above are a few examples of what can be done with the soul.  The usage
of the command (ie whether you use and at or a with or whatever... well,
just use what seems right... It should work)  To see what soul commands are
available to you at any given time type

> look at soul
Here are the commands in this hooppy soul.
#smile*       cry        poke+
....


Ok interpretation of the listing... (first degree course).  The # at the
front of the name, as in #smile, means that there are substitutable paramaters.
This mean that things are possible using this soul command.  To find all the
possible paramaters for a given soul comand use it and put in something that
is definately invalid. ie

> shake jshdf
Wrong... Error message:  head,leg,arm


The first one of the options is the default.  You can select the others by
doing things like

> shake l
You shake your leg.
> shake arm
You shake your arm.

Ok, I think that is about it...

Womble on.


if you find a missing command use the following command to get it added by
someone who can.

soul <text>

Examples:

soul bleed - I want to be able to bleed on people.

soul kick - I keep typing kick pinkfish and it fails!

soul snicker

soul smile spasmodically would be cute
