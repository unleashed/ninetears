You may have more than one character on Final Realms.
HOWEVER they must be played as totally separate characters.

They must NEVER be logged on at the same time,
and doing things like having one of your characters dropping
equipment or money for the other to pick up later
is considered cheating.
Also having one character killing NPC's so the other can complete a
quest or simillar is also considered cheating.

Basically if you wonder if you should be doing it, don't.
