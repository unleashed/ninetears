OMIQ - Online Mini Interactive Quest.
(Or "Oh Mygod I Quit!" for the faint-hearted)

This Saturday, Feb 1st, there will be held an OMIQ in the Realms.
The time for the OMIQ is set to:

	11:00 Central US Time
	19:00 Mud (Norway) Time

THINKING difficulty : 9

	This OMIQ will probably be the most difficult one to
date.  The faint of heart or mind need not attend, for only death awaits.
All players will have to listen carefully and pay attention to all
clues they can find, and had better be prepared to fight for thier
very lives.
 
*All ratings are on a difficulty scale of 1 to 10, Ten being the most
*difficult an OMIQ could be.  Players below level 15 are strongly advised
*against participating in any OMIQ with a Fighting difficulty of 5 or higher.
