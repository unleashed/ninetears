Syntax: cost <skillname> [to <level>] [by <level>]

This command gives you the amount of exeperience used to increase your level
by a given amount.  The syntax is the same as the advance command.  The
only difference is you can use all as the skill name.  This will give
you costs on all the skills you can currently raise.  This will give the
costs for advanceing yourself.  If you wish to see the costs for
advanceing in the guild you are in, try info.
