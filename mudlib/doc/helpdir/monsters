A few general comments which may not be covered elsewhere.
Don't assume that the monsters you meet are stupid, some have
proved to be smarter than the average adventurer. In particular
the smarter ones will remember who attacked them for quite some time,
they don't particularly like players logging out in fights either.

Town guards are, in general, particularly unforgiving, and may well
remember transgressors for quite a long time.
For this reason alone, it pays to show some loyalty to the town where you
reside. And in particular, where your guild is. 
It can be very distressing being killed by a town guard while on 
the way to advance.

Also as a general comment, monsters get the same skills and abilities as
players, so if a particular monster beats you up, your only consolation is
that as a player, there's a good chance that the ability is available to 
you as well. (Within guild limitations).
