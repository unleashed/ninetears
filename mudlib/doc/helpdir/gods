The idea is to give each race a primary god and to make sure each god
has a main races.  Some of them are somewhat questionable, but I could
find reasonable arguments for the placing.  And I could not find another
way to make it all balance.  On the first list the FIRST god entered is the
primary god for that race.  Others are alternates that the races can 
worship with possible limitations on the reward they get from it.

Drow: Cyrcia, Bivins, Ducky
Duergar: Grimbrand, Ducky, Cyrcia
Dwarf: Virga, Timion, Taniwha
Elf: Hokemj, Taniwha, Bivins 
Gnome: Taniwha, Virga, Baldrick
Goblin: Ducky, Grimbrand, Cyrcia
Halfling: Bivins, Hokemj, Baldrick
Half-Elf: Taniwha, Hokemj, Baldrick, Virga, Timion
Half-Orc: Timion, Grimbrand, Ducky, Baldrick
Human: Baldrick, Taniwha, Ducky, Timion, Bivins, Virga, Hokemj, 
       Grimbrand, Cyrcia
Lizard-Man: Baldrick, Timion, Bivins
Orc: Ducky, Grimbrand, Cyrcia


Written the other way:

Baldrick:  Human, Lizard-Man, Halfling, Half-elf, Half-orc, Gnome
Timion: Half-orc, Dwarf, Human, Half-elf, Lizard-man
Virga: Dwarf, Gnome, Half-elf, Human
Taniwha: Gnome, Half-Elf, Elf, Dwarf, Human
Hokemj: Elf, Halfling, Half-elf, Human 
Bivins: Halfling, Drow, Elf, Human, Lizard-man
Cyrcia: Drow, Goblin, Orc, Human, Duergar
Ducky: Orc, Goblin, Drow, Duergar, Half-orc, Human
Grimbrand: Duergar, Goblin, Half-orc, Orc, Human  


Graphically illustrating the primary races for each god/alignment, we see:
