Usage:  lsay <string>     Says what you want to say louder.

Something in between say and shout. You might need it for subtle effect maybe.

Example:  lsay Excuse me, but I am a frog not a guppy.
          You say loudly: Excuse me, but I am a frog not a guppy.
          Pinkfish says loudly: Excuse me, but I am a frog not a guppy.

Get the idea?
