     Players who have joined the following of a deity
may use this command to beseech thier deity for a
gift.  There is a slim chance that a prayer will be heard, and this
chance decreases when you pray more frequently.  If you pray
too frequently, your deity may become annoyed with you, and
may even punish you if you are too annoying.
 
The following options are available:
Money - ask for a monentary gift.
Power - ask your deity to restore your guild points (gp).
Healing - ask your deity to restore your hit points (hp).
Blessing - ask for a bonus to hit and to saving throws.
Strength - ask your deity to increase your strength.
Wisdom - ask your deity to make you more intelligent and wise.
Experience - ask for a gift of experience.
 
Note that Blessing, Strength, and Wisdom are temporary
effects and go away with time.  Also note that all effects and
your chance of having your prayers answers are based on your
level and standing with your deity.
