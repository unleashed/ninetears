There are basically four forms of equipment you can have:

1:  Armors
2:  Weapons
3:  Food/drink
4:  Misc items

To use armor, simply type       'wear <armor-name>'    Ex: wear chainmail
To wield a weapon, simply type  'wield <weapon-name>'  Ex: wield katana
To eat and drink, simply use 'eat <food>' or 'drink <drink>'

If you quit and have some equipment on you, the first 15 items will auto_load,
so you'll have them when you start playing next time.  The rest will be lost
to save some space in the player files.
