Syntax: consent <type> <on/off>

This is used to turn on or off consent for a given type of
action.  The currently valid types are:

resurrection:  if you withdraw consent to resurrection, you will
not be able to be brought back from the afterlife by any player.
This prevents someone maliciously raising you only to kill you again
after.

drinks:  This will allow other people to buy you drinks at
a bar.  You may wish to turn this off, for extreme drunkenness has
some nasty side effects.

follow: This will allow or disallow people to follow you.  Note
that with this consent off, it is still possible for someone to attempt to
follow you, but their success will be based on your and their
dexterity.  Also, this only affects new followers; for example, if you
have someone following you then turn consent off, that person
will still be following you.

tag: On if you wish to play any one of a number of silly but non-lethal 
    games. Off if you don't want to be bothered by sundry silly persons.

Examples:
  > consent resurrection off

  > consent drinks on
