When items won't load here an IOU is generated which you
can, with luck, reclaim later.
Some items may stay out of play for quite a while.
If they won't reclaim after a few weeks and "examine iou" shows
that they aren't particularly valuable, then just bury them on a corpse.

Most iou's should be reclaimable within a few days.
