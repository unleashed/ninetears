Languages have been added just to get some more spice into the game.
Each race will havwe their own language in addition to common (spoken
by all) and grunt. To switch between languages, use the command 'speak'.

Examples:

speak          ; Get a list of the languages you have learned
speak grunt    ; Start to speak grunt (noone will understand you)
speak common   ; Everyone will understand
speak drow     ; Only drow and those who have learned drow will understand
