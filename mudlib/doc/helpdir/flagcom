capture <person>   : This only works on ghosts.  If you capture an
                     enemy, you can drag them back to your jail.  You
                     only have a limited time to deposit them in the jail.
                     Logging out while holding ghosts means you lose them.

release <person>   : Release a ghost from your custody.

jail <person>      : At your team's jail, use this to throw a ghost you have
                     captured in the lockup.

free prisoners     : If you have killed all defenders at an enemy team's
                     jail, use this to free your friends.

teamwho            : List the members of your team.

And finally, you have a team-channel available to you.  use your team-name
as the command to talk on it.  So if you are wearing a red armband, just
type 'red <text>' to talk.
