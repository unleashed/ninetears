Syntax: monitor <on/off>

Monitor is a hit point monitor that goes on during combat.  This tells
you the current state of your hit points and guild points.  Whilst you
have monitor on you will not gain hit points or guild points during a
battle.  Monitor by itself will toggle states.

Examples:

> monitor on
Your hit point monitor is now on.
> monitor off
Your hit point monitor is now off.
> monitor
Your hit point monitor is now on.
