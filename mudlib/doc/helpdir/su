Restricted to immortals only.

Su stands for switch user.  It will let you log in as a different person without
actually quitting from the mud and logging in again.  Effectively it will quit
you and then start logging you in as the name you specify.  It will then ask
for a password.  You can then login as normal.

Examples :

su ducky
su telsar
