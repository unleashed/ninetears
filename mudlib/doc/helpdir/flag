The objective of this game is to capture the opposing teams' flags.
When you login, you will be assigned a team.  It will be your 
responsibility to meet with the members and determine strategies.

Each team will have a flagroom, which they must defend, along with
a jailroom in which to keep members of the opposing teams.  It would
be wise to defend both areas.  You can tell who your enemies are by
what color armbands they wear.

* You cannot enter a flag room until all defenders have been killed or
  have fled.
* You may be raised and rejoin the game at any time.
* You may throw vanquished (dead) foes in your team's jail to keep them
  out of the game.
* You must "check in" at your headquarters before you are eligible to play.
* This is a contact sport.  Be prepared to be killed and/or lose equipment.
