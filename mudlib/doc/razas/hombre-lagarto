Lizard-men are nebulous and secretive creatures, keeping to themselves in
deserts and river-banks (depending on their heritage).  They are tall
(sometimes in excess of 7'!) and muscular, and covered in a natural mesh of 
green and brown scales--giving them a spotted appearance.  Lizard-men have a 
savage lifestyle, raiding and pillaging surrounding villages, or hunting and
fishing in less populated areas.  Their attack strategies vary, depending on
the odds.  Lizard-men prefer an all-out, berserk attack when outnumbering their
foes, and resort to ambushes and sneak attacks when less confident of the 
outcome.  Lizard-men have yellow or orange eyes with narrow slits as pupils,
and tails (non-prehensile) that run from 3' to 4' long.

Lizard-men are quick and strong, especially over their native terrain.  Since
they are secluded, however, their ways seem backward to most other races, and
their minds have developed in different directions.  Lizard-men do not make
superior spell-casters, although some of the elite do learn a bit of the art.
These amphibious creatures perceive light levels as most humans, but are not
quite as well adapted to the dark.
