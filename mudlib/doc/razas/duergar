Far under the deepest, blackest tunnels of the earth lie the Duergar.  The
Duergar resemble Dwarves, save that their skin is a pale to dark gray.  They
dress in dark clothing--blending with their environment.  Although they appear
as sullen and emaciated forms of their Dwarven cousins, they are particularly
nasty to face in battle, and some learn the art of spellcasting.  Duergar are
ferociously evil, hating all that live on the surface of the earth.  The 
Duergar prefer sneak attacks when in single numbers, and many have felt the
icy hot pain of a knife in their back while venturing too far down their
tunnels.  Duergar are also proficient in the making and use of poisons.

These gray Dwarves make excellent fighters and priests--some have been known
to combine the two.  They are a strong, wise, durable race and have
adapted to complete darkness.  The Duergar do not venture forth from
their dark caverns often--their eyes burn like fire in the bright light, but
stay hidden deep within their tunnels mining for gold, gems, and mithril--a
metal so light and strong even the Elves covet it, as it holds magical 
enchantments as no other alloy.  The Gray Dwarves have been known to snake
their way to the surface on the blackest of nights to pay revenge to those who
would successfully steal from their stores of weapons and armour.
