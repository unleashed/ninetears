nroffed_file ({0,"Usage : ed <file/object>Ed is the editor that you can use from inside the mud.  Following is the listof commands that can be obtained from inside ed by typing 'h'.  The file youspecify will be expanded and if it matches to more than one file, the firstfile you specify will be used.  If the file cannot be written by you, it willalso print [read only].  Any changes you make, will not be saved if that is thecase.  Ed is very similar to ex and ed on unix machines so if you can finddocumentation for those commands, it will help you in ed.       Help for Ed  (V 2.0)---------------------------------     by Qixx [Update: 7/10/91]Commands--------/       search forward for pattern?       search backward for a pattern=       show current line numbera       append text starting after this lineA       like 'a' but with inverse autoindent modec       change current line, query for replacement textd       delete line(s)e       replace this file with another fileE       same as 'e' but works if file has been modifiedf       show/change current file nameg       Search and execute command on any matching line.h       help file (display this message)i       insert text starting before this lineI       indent the entire code (Qixx version 1.0)j       join lines togetherk       mark this line with a character - later referenced as 'al       line line(s) with control characters displayedm       move line(s) to specified linen       toggle line numberingp       print line(s) in rangeq       quit editorQ       quit editor even if file modified and not savedr       read file into editor at end of file or behind the given lines       search and replaceset     query, change or save option settingst       move copy of line(s) to specified linev       Search and execute command on any non-matching line.x       save file and quitw       write to current file (or specified file)W       like the 'w' command but appends insteadz       display 20 lines, possible args are . + -Z       display 40 lines, possible args are . + -For further information type 'hc' inside ed where c is the command you wanthelp on.Examples:ed /global/wiz*ed /ENTERed test.c",})
