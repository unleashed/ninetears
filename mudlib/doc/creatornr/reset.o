If LAZY_RESETS is defined in options.h in the driver, reset() will only be called in objects when they are touched (near players), so unused objects will not be loaded from the swap file to reset.  The reset() call is usually used to check if any treasures and/or monsters in the room have been removed so they can be replaced.  ","See also",7,5,"create()",})
