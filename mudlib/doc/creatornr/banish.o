The valid reasons can be seenby just typing 'banish' without any arguments.The second form of the command tells you what names, if any, are banishedbecause of <reason>. The last form tells you if a certain name has beenbanished, and if so, why.Reasons:  npc - banish the name of any unique (named) creature (eg fred, hrun)  race - banish races as being names (eg orc, elf, fox, etc) similar to above.  god - the gods of the land (eg Tymora)  deadplayer - these are dead players (run out of lives) do NOT use this reason  badplayer - banish a player who has been naughty, you have to move/delete              the player file first, thus you have to be a high-lord to do this  confusing - such as 'you' 'all' etc.See also:unbanish",})
