nroffed_file ({0,"Usage : grep <string> <files>Grep stands for Get Regular ExPression (I think) and if it doesn't, the unixversion will take a regular expression and search files for it.  The version onthe mud just takes a string and tries to find all occurances of it through thefiles specified.Examples:grep frog /std/living/*.cgrep this_player() test.cgrep am /log/APPLICATIONSUsage: grep <pattern> <files>Grep is used to search through the list of files given for any occurance of the pattern.  Useful if you are trying to find every file which has theword frog in it for instance.  The optional flag -n means that it doesntprint the line that the string occured on, it just prints the file name.Examples:grep frog /global/*grep -n frog *",})
