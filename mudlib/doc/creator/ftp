This is a method by which you can get files to and from the mud so that
you can edit them locally (safe from 'ed'!). The method you use is to
ftp to a ftp daemon here and there you will have access to your directory.
To find out how to use ftp type 'man ftp' on your local unix machine.
You login as your creator character, with its password. You may login
as anonymous/anonymous as well (but you obviously get less access).
The address for FTP'ing to Final Realms is:

fr.nrk.no 3005


In general you can only ftp to your own /w/xxxx dir and you need to use the FULL
pathname. i.e. put test.c /w/myname/test.c
