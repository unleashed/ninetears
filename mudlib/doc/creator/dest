Usage : dest <object>
      : dest query <object>

Dest is used to destruct objects.  The objects are located using wiz_present.
For information on how to define objects using wiz_present, see the file
/doc/creator/wiz_present.  Destruct will destruct a cloned instance
of an object or the original instance of the object.
The 'query' option will cause dest to ask you before desting
each object.

Examples:

dest test

dest every test in me

dest all in here except me
