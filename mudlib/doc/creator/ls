Usage : ls [directory]

ls is used to list the files in a directory.  Directories have a '/' appended
to them.  If no directory is given, it will default to your current directory.
You can also specify patterns to match to so that not all files will be listed.

Examples:

ls /std
ls /std/living/l*.c
ls /log/F*
ls examples/*.c
ls
