Usage le <command>

le is a last resort line editor.  It was put after we blew up ed.  Due to a
small bug, whenever we ran ed, the mud would crash.  Consequently, there now
exists an editor that requires no call outs.

Commands:
d - delete current line
/<text> - search
><text> - insert text
<n> - goto line number
r <file> - read file
w [<file>] - write file
N - initialise le
+ - forwards a line
- - backwards a line
z - display 20 lines

Example of use:

le /std/object.c
le 93
le d
le i frog
le w
le I
