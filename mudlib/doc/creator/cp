Usage : cp <files> <file|dir>

The cp command is used to duplicate a file.  You can copy it into a different
directory keeping the same name, or copy it to a file of a different name
anywhere.  cp will not overwrite files, so you will have to rm the file that
is already there if you want to replace an old copy of a file with a newer
one.

Examples:

cp test1 test2

cp test1 testdir

cp test* testdir
