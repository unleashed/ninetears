Destinations can be specified in two ways.  The rooms will automatically 
inherit "path.h" whether you like it or not, so it is in your best interests
to put it there.  The format for path.h is

#define ROOM "d/FR/daggerford/"
#define CHAR ROOM+"chars/"

The two ways you can specify rooms are the full pathname like
/d/FR/daggerford/ladyluck, /w/ducky/workroom, /room/garden

or just the name of the room which will be expanded to ROOM+"name"
ladyluck, barracks, tymora

The full pathname should be used for rooms that are in different directories,
while the room name alone should be used for rooms in the same directory.
