void set_store_room(mixed ob)
		Sets the storeroom to the given object.  The store room
		is where all the objects sold to the shop are kept.

void set_sell_message(mixed str)
void set_buy_message(mixed str)
void set_value_message(mixed str)
void set_browse_message(mixed str)
void set_list_message(mixed str)
		Very cute functions.. These allow you to set the message
		that is told to the person and to every one in the shop.
		The format of the thing passed is a string if both the
		message to the person and everyone else is the same or
		an array containing both messages.  Eg
		set_sell_message( ({ "Korbus says: Here take this $ob$.\n"+
                    "Korbus says: I dont want it anymore, so I am selling it "+
                         "you cheap for just $money$.\n"+
                    "Korbus gives $ob$ to you.\n",
		    "Korbus says to $client$: Here take this $ob$.\n"+
                    "Korbus says to $client$: I dont want it anymore, so I am "+
                         "selling it you cheap for just $money$.\n"+
                    "Korbus gives $ob$ to $client$.\n" });
		There are three things which are expanded in the arrays.
		The $ob$ is expanded to the short of the object, the
		$money$ is expanded to the cost, or the amount recieved
		for it, $client$ is expanded to the players name (short)
		and $extra$ is expanded to any extra information passed.
		The extra field is only used in the browse mwssage for
		the long of the object.

mixed query_list_mess()
mixed query_value_mess()

		Returns what the messages are set to.  See above for
		details of they can be set to.
void set_open_condition(mixed str)
		The open condition sets up when the shop will and wont
		sell things to you.  If it is set to a string the
		function of that name is called on the shop object to
		determine if the shop is open or not.  If the function
		returns a zero it is closed.  If the condition is set to
		an array it calls the function open_cond[1] on
		open_cond[0].  ie 
		set_open_cond("/d/ss/daggerford/korbus", "korbus_dead");
		Will call the function korbus_dead on the object
		/d/ss/daggerford/korbus.

void do_parse(mixed arr, object ob, object client, string money,
