Humans are the only race that has no guilds barred to        them.Elf: Elves are a quick forest-dwelling race. They are more dextrous than humans,     but are not as susceptible to pain. They are good at moving silently and     somewhat better than humans with magic.Half-elf: A halfblood human/elf.Dwarf: Dwarves are a stout mountain-dwelling race. They are totally without        magical potential, but can be good clerics. Dwarves are much like the       mountain they live in: Rock-steady and dour. They are generally quite       good fighters.Halfling: Halflings take their name from the fact that they are half as tall as          humans. They are very dextrous and susceptible to pain, but are not          very strong and world-wise.Orc: Orcs are normally not considered to be a player race, but monsters. They     are much the same way here: They are played as monster-players, meaning     anyone who wants to kill them may try without fearing any punishment.     Orcs are better at fighting than the other races. Many guild will refuse     to train orcs due to their vile nature.Half-orcs: A halfblood human/orc. Half-orcs are not monster-players, but share           some of the characteristics of orcs, meaning they are strong fighters           but not very intelligent.Duergar: Dark Dwarves. Evil inclined money grubbers. Tough warriors and worshippers of Grimbrand.Drow: Dark Elves. Probably the definitively evil race in the realms. They have their owndark guilds covering most of the bases and can join some ofteh undiscriminating surface guilds. The trick lies in living thatlong, the underdark is a tough place, and the tunnels in and outamongst the roughtest of areas.Lizard-man: Standoffish and mysterious. Lizard-men are really onlyknown for their fighting ability. While not able to breathe underwater, they are far better swimmers than any other races andhave been seen in mid-ocean, swimming from island to island. A featwhich is beyond most other races.",})
