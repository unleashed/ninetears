Why a second testperiod ?  We'll try to explain.  The Builders here have one goal, that is to make this the best or at least the most roleplayable Mud around. And the way to reach this goal is testing, methods of use, and make a good balance between all parts of the system we use.   Some Muds just open up and goes on. We won't officially open this Mud until we are certain we have reached our goals.   But, this Mud is open in the manner that it is playable. Most of the systems and areas works, and bugs are fixed every day. We don't have any more bugs right now than a usual Mud. But we have higher goals.  So, we hope you will play here, just as it was an open Mud. This is the only way we can iron out the flaws in the system.type 'help beta' for info on how to register bugs.",})
