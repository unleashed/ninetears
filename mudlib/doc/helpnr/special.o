nroffed_file ({0,"FR-MUD will officaly be opening for player on August the 19th, 1992 at12:00 (midnight) GMT.  Using an incredibly advanced DW mudlib, it istruly among the most advanced MUDs.  -- skill-based (Buzzword!)  -- Has an ip of fenris.dhhalden.no 2001   -- 3.1.2 running its own 3.0 mudlib in native mode.  -- theme based on the Forgotten Realms Fantasy Setting by TSR.  -- *NOT* based on anything having to do with TMI!  -- Advanced parsing lets you do neat things like light all torches,     light three torches, get three torches from frog, get all from corpses,     drop 1/2 of torches and any sort of permutation in between!  -- Neat combat system has different kinds of attacks (blunt, edged,     hand-to-hand).  You'll love it, I guarantee.  -- The finest weather system ever written for LPmud.  (Even moon phases.)  -- The infamous Pinkfish soul (207 commands, more arguments than anyone     ever *should* know.  -- Built-in aliases allow any number of arguments.    -- Nicknames, too.  -- A finger command that's actually useful.  --Great taste.Ducky",})
