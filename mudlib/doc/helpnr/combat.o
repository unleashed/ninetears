Youcan initiate combat by either typing 'kill <thing>' or by casting an offensivespell at the thing.  You can kill monsters or other players.  Player-killing is not a very good thing to do, and if it happens often and with no good reason:   expect to hear from me (Ducky) or even expect your character to be deleted.When you are in combat, you will automatically get an attack every 2 secondswhich is how often your heartbeat happens.  If for some reason, the monstershit you, but you do not hit back, try typing 'restart' which is the commandto restart your heartbeat.  Occasionally things go wrong and this will happenbut it isn't a common occurance so please tell a Ducky if you find a way ofmaking it happen.During combat, you can cast spells at the rate of 1 per heartbeat.  You mayfind some spells that can be cast instantaneously and don't happen on theheartbeat, but these spells will usually not be damage spells and there willbe no real problem in casting lots of them at once.  For a list of thespells you know, type 'spells' and to use them type 'cast spell target'.Some guilds will also give players combat commands that do damage similar tothat of the spells of magic using guilds.  A fighters guild might give thumpand headbutt commands, while a thieves guild would probably have backstab.All players have spell points (guild points) even if they don't cast spells.If they do cast guild points will be used in the process.  Of course fightersusing combat commands like thump and headbut will not use guild points.  Thename is meaningless.  You could consider the combat commands to the be fightersform of spell.  Fighters do of course have the dissappear spell where theycan make any amount of food dissappear almost instantaneously.The object of a combat of course is to be alive at the end of it, standing overthe corpse of the person you were fighting.  The less desirable outcome is beingmade to have a brief chat to Death.  These things happen and you will be boundto die sooner or later.  Life's tough.",})
