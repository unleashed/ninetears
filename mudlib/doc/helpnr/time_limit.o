If you knowyou mud far too much, this command may be for you.When you reach your time-limit for the day or week, the mud will quityou at the next save.  Likewise, if you have exceeded your time-limit,the mud will not allow you to enter in the first place.Type 'time_limit' alone to see your current settings.Type 'time_limit clear' to remove your current settings.Examples:  time_limit 5 hours per day  time_limit 20 hours per weekNOTE:  for historic reasons, weeks begin at 01:00 on Thursday mornings.  days begin at 01:00.  Norwegian time, of course.",})
