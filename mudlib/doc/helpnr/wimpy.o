Ifyou have set the number to zero (default) you are in brave mode and wontrun away even if you are almost dead (in fact even if you are dead).Warning however, the experience points you recieve for doing damage to amonster will be lower the higher your wimpy.  If you set your wimpy to100% you will loose 100% of your xp.  Bing!See also:verbose, follow, lose",})
