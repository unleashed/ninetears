nroffed_file ({0,"Forgotten RealmsThe Forgotten Realms is a fantasy setting that originates in a setting in arole-playing game called Advanced Dungeons and Dragons. The Forgotten Realmsis a whole world of exciting and exotic places. Of course this can't all beprogrammed into this cute little MUD, but we hope to catch some of the      athmosphere of this world. The Forgotten Realms was made by various artistsworking for TSR either as freelancers or full-time. The reasons why I've chosen Forgotten Realms as the setting for this MUD are that:1: The different areas are incredibly varied.2: At Thursdays we role-play in this setting at this University.3: There are first-class documentation and other source materials for FR.4: It's probably the most popular game-setting ever, and last and most important5: I just LOVE Forgotten Realms!The PlayerAs any devotee of the Lady would attest, the cosmos is full of creatures playinggames (or perhaps bad jokes). As luck would have it, you find yourself a playerin the grand designs of the Creators, earning your fame and fortune as a hero(or better still, not getting yourself killed).The creators, for lack of anything better to do, are responsible (blameworthy?)for the world around you. You, however, have the far more interesting, andperilous, task of exploring their machinations, and perhaps even enjoyingyourself along the way.The Game DesignFor those accustomed to Universes of far less imaginative design, FR-MUDis an LP mud of a different origin. Rather than a place where one srabbles forthe \"coveted\" position of wizard, then becoming as bored as the gods, a muchhappier mud is one in which being a player is purposeful. And, in fact, that isTHE purpose of the game. Here, being a player is heart and soul (and otherinteresting bits) of the game. And, as a player, you will gain most of thewonderful abilities available only to wizards on other muds (e.g. emote, echo,force, etc.). Even I, being a God (highest possible title) on this MUD need not be of higher level and better at combat than a normal player. So I'll walk among you playing just like the rest of you.As with any LP mud, the chance to code is there for any who can or care tolearn. Upon reaching a certain level you may petition for creator status.However, to become a creator is to merely get a chance to code; all the funabilities foremerly of wizardhood are available to players for completing questsand the like. Fear not, however! As a creator you will maintain your status as aplayer, and crush things with the best of them--just not while logged on as acreator.Ducky",})
