nroffed_file ({0,"This is supposed to be a role-playing game, so at some point, we'dappreciate you making an effort to consider the role you wish to play here.To ensure that you do this, you'll find that you can't advance beyondlevel 10 without being registered. All that we ask is that you set yourdescription, \"help describe\" will give an example.You can then ask any immortal to register you. Do this at any time onceyou are out of the newbie areas. Waiting till level 10 isn't a good idea,as you may be stuck unable to advance for a few hours.We'd also appreciate that those of you who can set your finger info at thesame time. The command is \"chfn\". This makes it more likely to be helpful with situations such as lost passwords, things like that. It's optional,but advised.",})
