nroffed_file ({0,"A client is a program you use instead of telnet that will give severalbenefits. They allow you to make triggers that react upon text receivedfrom the mud, make special alias, scroll back in text you're writing,go back in history to repeat commands and you can use it for automaticlogins at your favourite mud(FR).Some clients allows you to do shell commands as well while still beingconnected.You can also be connected to several worlds at the same time and switchbetween them easily.-known clients:                 tinyfugue, tintin(++), cancan, lptalkLook at your local ftp host that mirror large archives to find the oneyou would like to try. If you want to try tinyfugue and you have questionsabout it, you could drop me (Manshoon) a mail.PS:  You need to have a unix account to install a client.",})
