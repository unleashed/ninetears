nroffed_file ({0,"PARTY -- Memorial Day Weekend -- May 1996There's a party scheduled for Memorial Day Weekend,Cookeville, TN at the residence of the \"MUDHole\"Everyone is welcome!  Bring something to sleep on andfood, we can't afford to feed ourselves, much less you.We won't have a display of our local god as in Kansas,but hopefully it will be as fun.  For more info or if you ARE coming, mail me (Radix) soI'll know what to expect. T-Shirts -> I need to know ahead of time if you are are going to purchase one.  They're $11 each, add $2I think for XXL or XXXL.  If you can, sending the money ahead of time would be greatly appreciated.There's some profit off this, but it's to cover my butt incase I can't sell the 50 shirts being made.First come, first serve, so mail requests are priority.If there is anything leftover, it goes into food orbeverage for the multitudes staying.
