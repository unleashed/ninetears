( luck)When you start your stats will be quite low. 8's or so. You can roll fornew stats (see rearrange). However it pays to consider which guild youwant to join before doing this. In general 18 in the most important stats for your guild, followed by highcon and as many others as you can get high. Strength < about 12 makes lifedifficult due to limited carrying capacity.Guideline: You should be able to get 3 stats in the 17-18 range and the rest             above 14 or so with patience.At any time during the game you may use the command: rearrange.    See also: ability, rearrange.",})
