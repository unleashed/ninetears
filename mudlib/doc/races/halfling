Halflings (or Hobbits, as they call themselves) are merry, hearty folk who 
dwell in nice, lush peaceful hilly areas.  Although shy of most races, 
the rare Halfling will leave his peaceful life and seek adventure.  Most
Halflings prize food and drink over caverns of gold, and in doing so, they
are inclined to be fat.  They are short (up to 4' tall), have good-natured
faces as opposed to beautiful, and have bright, keen eyes, and a rug of wooly
hair on their feet.  Halflings mistrust most races, although they get along
quite well with Dwarves, Humans, and even Elves.  Their homes usually consist
of a hole dug into the side of a hill with large round doors and windows and
lavish furnishings within.

Hobbits have the ability to walk without sound when they set their minds to
it, which comes in handy when trying to avoid the perils of the wild, or to
slip out the back room when an unwanted visitor arrives.  They are clever
with their hands, and sturdy (stemming from their close relationship to the 
earth).  Halflings are not overly strong due to their size, and have moments
of great weakness (especially when food or tobacco is involved).  The halfling
sees well in normal lighting conditions, but has to squint to see in bright 
light.
