Tough, stocky, and stubborn, the Dwarves mine their gems in underground 
caverns.  Gold is most precious to them, and many a dwarf has gone mad for
the lust of it.  Apart from their weakness for wealth, Dwarves are a most
noble race.  They stand a couple feet shorter than most humans, but are as
tough as nails.  All Dwarves wear beards (even the women!) and spend much
time growing and maintaining them.  Since their territories often conflict,
Dwarves have a natural hatred for Orcs and Goblins, sometimes killing them on
sight, even though facing unsurmountable odds.  Dwarves also strongly distrust
elves and most other races, for there is no dwarven word for Compromise.

Dwarves are sturdier and stronger than humans, with their thick muscles and 
tough bones, and their long life-spans give them extra wisdom of how the 
world works.  Unfortunately, their size makes them less agile, and their
lust for great wealth sometimes clouds their vision.  A Dwarf's eyes may begin
to hurt under bright light, but they tend to see more in the darkness than
humans.
