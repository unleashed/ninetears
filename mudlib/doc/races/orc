Orcs are the creation of a very evil, powerful wizard.  They were made in
mockery of elves--but the long-forgotten power that formed them had only the
power to pervert, not create.  Orcs are truly foul creatures that feed on 
anything with a pulse.  Their preferred diet is Human or Elven flesh, although
they are not too picky to eat their own kind and kindred.  Orcs are large,
brutish creatures with overdeveloped arms (sometimes reaching below their
knees!), crooked legs, and stooped backs.  They are covered in a wiry fur that
tends to reek of decay and death.  Orcs have black to glowing red eyes, and a 
face that ends in a snout adorned with underbiting fangs.

Orcs are adapted to fighting--many a powerful wizard have kept them in their
service solely for that purpose, sweeping away all opposition in a wave of 
terror.  They are exceptionally slow-witted, often fighting amongst themselves
out of sheer boredom, and they have little to no innate magical ability.  Orcs
detest the bright light of the sun, and usually pillage in the black of night,
or under a bright moon.
