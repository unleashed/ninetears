Goblins are shorter than humans, black, furry, and generally disgusting.  
Saying they are "Stupid" might be a little unfair, since after calling one so,
the taunter tends to wind up freshly killed, and eaten.  Goblins dwell in
the subterranean parts of the world, living out their twisted lives by 
pillaging and stealing from neighboring villages at night.  Goblins eat that
which they kill, feeding them on to greater attrocities.  Goblins hate
everything, elves, men, dwarves, gnomes, light, even themselves.

Although thin, the Goblin is very sturdy--those who are not do not live past
their childhood.  They are quick of hand, and do not hesitate to backstab, if
they know the skill.  Fortunately, the goblin is slow-witted, and has
difficutly learning spells.  If the goblin were intelligent, they might have
a chance of conquering the world, making it a much darker place.  Goblins
detest light, and cannot see in brighter areas.  They wait for their prey to
come out at night, or enter their goblin-infested caves.
