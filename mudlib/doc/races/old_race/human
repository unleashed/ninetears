Humans are the most common of the races in the Realms.  They tend to live
in cities, but are often found in all the other environments.  They rarely
venture underground though, because of their poor night-vision.

Humans get no racial modifiers, and can be considered to be a very average'ish
race.

Humans start in the fair city of Oceanfall, in a nice city-house.
