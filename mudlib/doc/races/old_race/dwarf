Dwarves are a short, yet stocky race.  They are very proud, and not
afraid of much.  They are a race of warriors.  They are proud of many
things, their name, their beard, and most of all: their weapon.  They
are known to live in caves and tunnel complexes.  They are also known
for their inate ability to create with stone and metal.  Some of the
finest weapons come from them, and the most fascinating architecture is
located in ancient dwarven caverns.

What they lack in heigth, Dwarves make up in strength and stamina.  They
are short and stocky so they are not known to be dexterous, and most of
them are to be known as "dense" (as halflings fondly call them.)  But
they have powerful muscles and have the stamina of half a dozen humans.

Dwarves start out in a dwarven cave complex near Oceanfall.
