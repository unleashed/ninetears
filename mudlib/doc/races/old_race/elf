Elves are a gentle and very artistic race, they are slender and seem to
be very delicate; However, it has been many times that a large human has
started a fight with these wise creatures and regretted it.  The Elves
of Magisk Jord are of faerie blood and their grace and dexterity in
combat show for it.  They are a good foot and a half shorter than the
average human.

Elves have excellent nightvision and can become a decent amount of
character classes.  They are more dextrous than humans but have far less
constitution.  Drow elves are rumoured to have superior intelligence
than their light-skinned cousins, but they sacrifice most of their
charisma for this bonus.

All Elves except Dark start in the Elven Forest, outside of Oceanfall.
Dark Elves start in the deadly
Banefall.
