Half-elves are a mix of the dextrous elfin and the human race.  They are
somewhat more slender and delicate than humans and of course more compact
than elves.  

Half-elves have quite good nightvision and can become several mixes of
character classes.  They are a bit more dextrous than humans but on the
negative side have less constitution.

Half-elves start either in a human home in the city Oceanfall or in an elfin
forest.
