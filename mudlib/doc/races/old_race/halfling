Halflings are a small "child-like" race.  They are known for their lack
of fear and their amazing dexterity.  They are as small as a human
child, and are very innocent acting.  They have been known to be some of
the best theives around, and are sometimes to be found very annoying.
They are not very efficient in combat unless it is by using a missile
weapon to fire into the battle, or they are backstabbing their opponent.

Halflings are far more dextrous than a human, and more so than even a
swift elf, however, they lack in constitution and strength what they
gain in speed.  Their lack of strength does not make them the best of
warriors, but their quick hands and lack of fear make them the best of
theives.

All Halflings start in their hometown of Farway or in the immense port
city of Oceanfall.
