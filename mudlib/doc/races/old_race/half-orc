Half-Orcs are a cross between a Orc and a Human.  They usually live in
a human society, yet seem to have the etiquette of a common orc.  They
do sometimes however get offended at insults, because they seem to
understand it is an insult, unlike their ignorant cousins.  They make
good warriors.

Half-Orcs fair better in intelligence than their orcish cousins, but
lack all of the constitution that the orcs maintain.  They are just
about as ugly as their cousins.

Half-Orcs begin in the former capitol of Daggerford.
