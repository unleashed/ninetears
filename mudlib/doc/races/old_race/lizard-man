Lizard-men are a strong race of reptile-men.  They are often viewed as
a difficult race to get along with, but are far from the monsters they
look like being.  Lizard-men are competent with using their tail instead
of their feet, like other races.

Lizard-men are very limited in the professions they can choose, and their
choices range from several kinds of fighters to clerics.

Lizard-men start in a small city in the swamps south of Daggerford, a
multirace city.
