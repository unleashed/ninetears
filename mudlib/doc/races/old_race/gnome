Gnomes are the smallest of the "civilized" races of Magisk Jord.  They
are intelligent creatures that have one main goal in life: to learn.
This is the reason that they have some of the more knowledgable sages,
and most powerful illusionists.  They are also known for some strange
inventions, they were rumoured to have built a "skyship" but that rumour
was never confirmed.

Gnomes are nimble, very intelligent creatures, however they lack
tremendously in strength, and are not known for great constitution of
charisma.  They are not known for combat skill, and are in fact known to
be intimidated easily, however, beware the gnome that you cross paths
with.  They are known to use trickery and ingenuity to take revenge upon
their enemies. This revenge can be very funny and humiliating or it
could be very deadly.

Gnomes begin their life on Magisk Jord inside the Gnome Burrows, near
Oceanfall.
