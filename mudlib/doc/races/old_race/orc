Orcs are large humanoid creatures that look to have the face of a cross
between a ugly human and a wild boar.  They are very rude, crude, and
annoying.  They pleasure in starting fights and picking on the weak.
Yet they seem to be prime targets of Halflings, who constantly are
playing tricks on the unsuspecting Orc.  They are not proud, and not
intelligent.  However they make good fighters when directed properly and
have even been known to make okay necromancers.

They are very strong and have average dexterity, and above average
constitution.  They however have low intelligence and charisma.  They
are large humanoids, and have broad shoulders, and a toothy snout.

Orcs start in a Orcish "habitat" (A pigsty, hellhole, cave as the
halflings say.)  The "habitat" is located near Oceanfall.
