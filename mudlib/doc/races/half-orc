Half-orcs are the product of a union (usually rape) between an orc male, and a
human female.  Half orcs are hairier than humans, have a low, skulking 
forehead, and muscular, yet disgusting bodies.  Where Half-elves are accepted
in the villages of their related offspring, Half-orcs are shunned at best,
sometimes ridiculed, stoned, killed, lynched, or eaten.  On rare occaisions,
Half-orcs are permitted to band with their Orcish bretheren, provided they
look "Orcish" enough to pass for one.  Half-orcs make effective thieves and
fighters, but the relatively slow wits they inherit from their Orcish parent
(sometimes their human parent as well!) tend to inhibit them from pursuing
other, more meaningful professions.

Half-orcs are stronger than their human parents, and quite unruly.  Oft this
has led to an early dismissal from their parents homes.  They are 
ill-tempered creatures, and the results of the poor social position they are
forced into at birth tends to cloud their wits.  Half-orcs can see in darker
places than most humans, but normal daytime sunlight tends to hurt their eyes.
