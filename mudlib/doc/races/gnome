The cave-dwelling Gnome prefers darkness to light.  This does not reflect their
good-natured disposition, though.  Shorter than dwarves, the gnome dwells deep
in cave-cities, pursuing his interest in all knowledge of all things.  Lust
for gold is not in a gnome's heart, just a desire for a deeper understanding
of the world.  Although they resemble small dwarves, the gnome has a shorter
beard, and a very pronounced nose.  Gnomes are inclined to dabble with magic,
and their life-span (sometimes over half a millenium!) gives them ample time
to pursue their art.  Gnomes have a natural hatred for goblins, but tend to
outwit them, rather than use brutish force.  Apart from foul goblins, gnomes
tend to get along with anyone of similar good alignment.

The Gnome is sharp-witted and clever, and their relationship to the earth
makes them hardy and durable.  Unfortunately their height, and lack of muscle
bulk make them avoid professions that rely on combat.  Gnomes see very well in
the dark, but bright lights make them squint, spoiling their vision.
