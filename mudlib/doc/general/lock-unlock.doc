	Thank you for being interested in this new method of locking/unlocking
doors and gates.  There are a few thngs that you need to know first:

(1).  This was a modification on the original, widely used room.c, and
	as such had to be able to be backwardly compatible...meaning it will
	work for all your previous rooms that you seek to lock down.

(2).  I warn you that it is confusing and that I had to weave it into the
	room.c I changed.  For two reasons:(1) I need to access the origial
	"do_exit_command" routine [takes you out of the room into a new
	room, and the use of the arrays and thenature of there conection to
	the exits required that this method be inbred not inherited. :)

(3).  Your rooms MUST inherit "/std/room1.c" inorder to lock/unlcok doors.

(4).  ONLY a gate or a door is lockable... no paths or whatnot like that.

(5).  You can only lock an inside door for now.. (I havn't done the outside
	one yet...(will do after this file is finished).

**Now for the moment you have all been waiting for** 

The Protocol:

add_exit("direc","path_of_destination","exit_type");  functions as normally.

	There are several valid "exit_type"s.. the default in my code and in
	the door_handler (what a door really is made of is found through check
	-ing the inherited files in room1.c)[not fun] -->default is not lock-
	able.   You must either define exit_type as "door" or "gate".. no
	variations!

Once you have secured this in your code you may proceed to lockaway.

The format of locked doors is:

door_lock(string "exit_name",int "lock_strength");

	The last argument "lock_strength" is optional and unless define will determine
	itself anew everytime the rooms re-sets up.  I strongly recommend the
	use of this nice random feature... as I promote random things highly.
	The argument "exit_name" is VERY imprortnat and MUST be the exact same
	name as the visible exit...

Okay Now the unlcok protocal is basically unnessessary. 

	BUt it is door_unlock(string "exit_name");

	I request that you do not code unlcok thing things int eh rooms lest
they be a lever hidden somewhere... (HINT)


**Things to come**

	I have nearly finished pick_lock.. it is NOT nor will be a guild
command  ...BUT only thieves can really do good at unlcok things.. So don't
start complaining...

	Lockpicks are in the gmae as of now..  I will try to finish my upgrades soon..
speak to  me if you have any questions (I Am Piper).

	I will soon be locking chest in a similar fashion! (99 % done)
I lack only the modifications to pick_lock.

	I will also make it possible for a person to lock a door with the 
pick_lock thing... but I see no reason that a key won't work the same.
door_lock() will funciton as a call... AND can be done anytime.. :)

	Lastly I am Piper.  I can answer all questions (HAH), but I will try.
