This ISN'T a function. But an explanation of how strings used in the monster
code are handled.

$ is a reserved character in the strings, which may be used in chats
set_join_fight_mess(), or basically anywhere we allowed a monster
to say anything.
They'll also talk in their own language.

The syntax is:
$Xstring$

X is one of m,l,a.o
m  == me
l = living object in the room
a = an attacker
o = any object in the room

string is one of:
name = ob->query_name()
cname = ob->query_cap_name()
gender = ob->query_gender_string()
poss  = ob->query_possessive()  (his hers)
obj = ob->query_objective()
   (him her)
gtitle = ob->query_gtitle()   (fancy one this one)
pronoun = ob->query_pronoun()  (he she it)
race = ob->query_race()  "drow, duergar, elf)
guild = ob->query_guild_name()  (fighter, wizard)
group = ob->query_group_name() (Pirate,Silver Fist)
clan  = ob->query_race_group_name() {R'yleh, Stonereaver)

Have fun :)
