This over-rides the normal tendancy of an NPC to autoattack
for particular groups.

add_loved(string group,mixed which)

string is one of:
"race"   won't autoattack a member of the selected race(s)
"guild"
"group"   SIG's
"clan"    Race groups, draven clans, Drow houses.
"player"  a particular player
"property"  Checks the target for the specified property(ies)
"alignment" Checks for a particular alignment BY NAME
            "angelic","extremely good","very good","good",
            "neutral",
            "evil","very evil","extremely evil","diabolical"

"deity"   for followers of a particular deity.

You'd normally set_aggressive(1) for this to be of any use.

See also add_hated()

Note:
You need to add ALL races, all groups in one line.

Examples:
add_loved("race","drow") is valide
add_loved("race",({"drow","duergar"})) is valid

add_loved(({"race","guild"}),"drow") is meaningless.
