varargs void set_aggressive(int aggr, int level)

Determines how monsters behave when a something enters the room.

Note that this interacts with add_hated and add_loved

Level is the level below which players are just ignored. Defaults to 0.

agrr
0       doesn't attack unless set hated applies in which case behaves as 1
1     autoattack non hidden players. Charisma check for non attack
2     autoattack non hidden anything. (monsters as well)
3    autoattack any player (hidden or not)
4   autoattack any living. (hidden or not)
5   As for 0. Special hack for add_hated. If add_hated check succeeds and
      aggr is 5, we use attack mode 2. (normal checks on all living, not just players)

Above 5. Kill 'em all. Don't use these, we may do "cute" things later
