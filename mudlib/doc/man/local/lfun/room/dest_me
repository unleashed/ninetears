dest_me
called when the room is destroyed.
You need to over-ride this if you've cloned items into the room.
(to make sure you destroy them and they don't sit round eating memory)

void dest_me()
{
   if(object) object->dest_me(); // clean up my stuff
   ::dest_me();			 // let the room do it's stuff
}
