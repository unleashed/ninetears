door_lock
Cute code to lock doors
int door_lock(string direc, string type,int str, int pub, int trap)

direc is the room exit to be locked , like "south"
type is one of


	"tumb"   
	"bolt"   
	"l_pin"  
	"catch"  
	"comb"   
	"cmplx" 
	"hid"   
	"magic" 
	"vary"   
        "tumb2"  

str 50 is moderately tough for a Level 20 thief 
    100 is uncrackable
    10 is doable my almost anyone with lockpicks        
    default is random 35-60
    	
pub no clue :) (optional anyway)

trap ""
