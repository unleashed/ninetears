add_item
adds descriptions you see when you look at something in the room.

add_item(mixed str,string desc)

add_item("twig","Yep, sure enough it's a twig");

you can also 
add_item(({"twig","branch"}),"Bits of a tree O.K.\n");

This will add multiple things with the same response.
Notes: Plurals. Don't need to, the MUD will take twig/twigs
	even branch/branches

See also: add_smell, add_sound, add_feel
(same syntax as above except, smell xxx , listen xxx , touch xxx)
also remove_item, modify_item
