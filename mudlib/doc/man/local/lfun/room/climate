Climate changes

Yes it is possible, it's also very very prone to being 
extreme.

add_property("climate",({ ({TEMP_OFFSET,WEIGHT}),
                          ({CLOUD_OFFSET,WEIGHT}),
                          ({RAIN_OFFSET,WEIGHT})
                               }) );
Keep the offsets small and the weights smaller.
i.e. small adjustments have major effects.

Play with a test room till you get it right.
