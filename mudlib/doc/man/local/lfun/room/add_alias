add_alias
add an alias for an something in the room

add_alias(mixed name,string str);
You have an item called "fred" in the room.
i.e. add_alias("kruger","fred");

or to save time
   add_alias(({"freddy","kruger"}),"fred");
   
Note:
   add_item() now includes this functionality without a few of
   the side effects, it's recommended that you use that instead
   of add_alias()
  
   There's also modify_alias , and remove_alias
   but since we'd rather you didn't use them anyway ....
