modify_exit
This allows any one of a number of cute things to be done to exits

int modify_exit(string direc, mixed *data)

Cute messages.
	"message"   writes a message when the exit used
	modify_exit("south",({"message","this is a message someone will get when the exit is used.\n"}));

Hidden exit.
	"obvious"   "obvious",0  (hidden), "obvious",1 (visible)
	modify_exit("south",({"obvious",0}));
	NOTE: even though hidden it's usable.


Conditional exit.
	"function"  calls a function, if 0 returns the exit is blocked, else it works
        modify_exit("south",({"obvious","function_called"}));
      
Exit size. (Seldom used on FR)
      "size"    "size",15
      modify_exit("south",({"size",15}));

Change exit point.
	"dest"
	modify_exit("south",({"dest","/new/path/to_exit"}) );

Unknown ones
"enter"

Currently unimplemented. (on the "to-fix" list)
	"open" open a door
	modify_exit("south",({"open",0}) ); // closed
	modify_exit("south",({"open",1}) ); // open
	
	"key" set the key the player has to have to open the door
	"other" no idea :)
	"open desc"  description of the open door
	"close desc" description of the closed door
	"undoor"	kill a door
	
	NOTE: The last few are not implemented currently
	      BUT probably can be if you need them back
