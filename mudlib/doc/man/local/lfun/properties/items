The following TIMED properties will automatically be passed on to the
appropriate NPC/player changes if added to an item
This is the APPROVED way of creating magic/special items.
I.e. boots of dex add_timed_property("dex",2,200000);
Shield of fire protection add_timed_property("fire",30,200000)

The following TIMED properties currently act this way.
"fire"
"cold"
"air"
"stone"
"electrical"
"magical"
"noguild"
"nocast"
"poison"
"dex"
"wis"
"str"
"con"
"int"
"cha"

The reason for using timed properties is that the magic wears off nicely.
Also it allows for player enchants at a later date.
You can make the duration reasonably long, but try to keep 
it less that 10 days or so. Thats about 2 000 000

On ITEMS. Note: Some of this hasn't been implemented yet. But should be soon

"cursed"   Items only. Curses them. 1-100, 100 is not removable by mortals.
           Note: Cursed items cannot be unwielded/unworn/dropped/sold etc.
