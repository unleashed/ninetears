QC guidelines:
These relate to items which are baseobs weapons, with only the descriptions
changed

+1 enchant.
	Doesn't need special approval but must be hard to get.
        I.e. the NPC with it must take a real effort to kill.

+2 enchant.
	Must be hard to get AND hard to find, Some elements of a quest
	involved. Players stand some risk of dying. (usually)
	Needs approval.

+3 enchant.
	Must be a major quest item. Something you wouldn't do alone unless
 	you had a death wish. Alternatively it can be obtained after a
	long time or require a lot of thinking.
	Will require serious QC to check the quest is worth the reward.

+4 enchant.
	One of a kind. You'd have to be utterly insane to try.
	> 50% death rate attempting it etc.
	Would require major convincing before it got approved.

+5 enchant.
	Kill Baldrick, take it from his corpse.

Armour. As above except the range of enchant is 10 greater.

0-9    No probs really
10-19  As for weapon +2
20-29  As for weapon +3

etc

	

Resistances etc conferred by weapons/armour
	Up to +10 is no problem
	+11-+30 must be a corresponding weakness elsewhere.
		i.e. +20 "fire" -20 "cold"

       Above 30% will NOT pass QC.

There are other effects that can be added to weapons/armours.

"man properties"

In general, these WILL need specific approval.

NOTE:
The above relate to baseobs weapons. 
If "clever" code is used, the weapon / armour will be judged on
the basis of the nearest comparable baseobs item.

In other words, iif it does too much damage it doesn't 
pass QC.
