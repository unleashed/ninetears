This works on both rooms and monsters. 
add_clone(NPCS+"rat",2); 
in a room setup will repopulate the room with 2 rats every reset.

add_clone(WEAPONS+"dagger",2);
if an NPC setup will equip the NPC with a pair of daggers.

We recommend using these functions for two reasons.
1) they are efficent.
2) They avoid some subtle bugs that can otherwise cause problems

For example if you try to load an NPC with equipment
thats too heavy normally he won't clone and the room will "what ?"
when a player enters.
add_clone() in an NPC checks for this and deals with it, the overly
heavy equipment just doesn't get loaded. And add_clone() in the room
also error checks.
