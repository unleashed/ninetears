Many of these docs came with MudOS.  Those that helped write them:
  Wayfarer, Truilkan, Huthar, Shadowhawk, Jacques, Cynosure,
  Blackthorn, Dwarf, Buddha, Beek, Robocoder, Zak

  Credit also goes to Lars for the documentation on which much of 
  the MudOS documentation is based.

Dozens have worked on the local documentation.  Hamlet would like
to give himself special credit for actually trying to arrange this
mess, though.
