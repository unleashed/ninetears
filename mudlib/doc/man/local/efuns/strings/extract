string extract(string str, int from, int to)

     Extract a substring from a string. Character 0 is first character. 
     extract(str, n) will return a substring from characer number n to the end.
     extract(str, i, j) will return a string from character i to character j.

     This is obsolete, though it is still retained as a simul_efun.  Use
     str[from..to] to get substrings of strings.
