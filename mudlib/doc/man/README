This is where the programmer's manual pages live.  In order to make
updating easier, the documentation that comes with MudOS is kept in
mudos/ and the local documentation is kept in local/.

The 'man' command merges data from the two directories, so their
structure should be kept parallel.  If the same document is found
in both the mudos and local directories, the local one is displayed.

Obviously, no changes should be made to the mudos/ directory.  If 
a page there is in error, it should be copied to the appropriate
local/ directory and modified.  Otherwise, it will be wrong once
again in the event that the mudos/ dir is updated in the future.

The file NO_README is needed for dirs that do not have a README
file.  Deleting it would be a bad idea.
