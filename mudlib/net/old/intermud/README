The INSTALL file should contain all the information you need to set up the
intermud system on your mud.

I have tried to make this package very flexible and portable by using a
modular format. The inetd.c itself is the hard core of the system and you
should not generally need to alter it in any way. It handles the complexities
of the encoding / decoding protocol, reply handling and time outs etc. The udp
directory contains files which handle specific incoming requests. Each
filename corresponds to the name of an intermud request. The inetd will call a
function udp_request() in the file udp/request.c, with a mapping containing
the decoded data as the argument. The request.c file should handle the data
(see the supplied files for examples). The inetd provides the tools you need
to set up your own intermud commands for players, but none are included. Look
in the examples directory for some sample implementations of intermud
commands. Read the PROTOCOL file for information on writing commands.
