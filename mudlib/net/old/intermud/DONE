Version 0.3:
~~~~~~~~~~~~
o send_udp() will not send requests that are not listed in the target hosts
  command list.
o Abbreviated mudnames can be used. send_udp() will do mudname completion as
  long as there is no ambiguity.
o receive_udp() logs the DATA field of system replies (ie. no recipient) if it
  exists.
o receive_udp() will send a 'request failed' reply and record a log if an
  incoming command is unknown or fails.
o Added some example files to help in writing intermud commands.
o Added 'finger' module.
o Any data fields of type object passed to send_udp() will be converted to
  file_name format on encoding.
o A file_name or object can be used as the SENDER field and replies will be
  directed to udp_reply(mapping data) in that object.
o Added 'channel' module.

Version 0.4:
~~~~~~~~~~~~
o The second (port) argument to send_imp() is typecast to an int for
  compatability with older drivers.
o Null fields are ignored in the encoding process to minimize packet size.
o inetd.c and the files in /udp have been rewritten to make them more portable
  and aid quick and easy installation of the basic intermud system.
o Int and string fields are guaranteed to be decoded correctly. Float support
  was removed for simplicity and to aid portability.
o Buffering is done on packets longer than the maximum transfer size.

Version 0.5:
~~~~~~~~~~~~
o Fixed bug with object encoding.
o Channel module modified to allow channel listings.
o Reply and ping requests moved from the inetd to seperate modules.
o Query and man modules added.
o Host data and access system rewritten.
o Previously unknown hosts are added dynamically with public privs.
o Field names in the data mapping are not restricted to strings.
o The DATA field guarantees correct decoding of strings and ints.

Version 0.6:
~~~~~~~~~~~~
o Added definition of INETD to udp.h.
o Renamed the LOG_FILE macro in udp.h to INETD_LOG_FILE to prevent clashes.
o Added simple reliability scheme (udp.h):
    Requests that expect a reply will be resubmitted up to RETRIES number of
    times after each TIME_OUT expires without a response.
o Added compatability to allow another intermud system (or interpretter) to
  run invisibly underneath the inetd package. (config in inetd.c)
o Added security checking to receive_udp() (config in inetd.c).
o Added diagnostics to inetd if required (udp.h):
    If used, the RESPONSE_TIME field will contain the number of seconds a
    reply took to arrive.
o Error checking in INETD_HOSTS file.
o Changed send_udp() to return 0 for success and an error message for failure.
o Muds are PINGed at load-time by the function startup() which is called via a
  call_out("startup", 1). set_host_list() is called normally from reset()/
  create(). This allows inetd.c to be loaded from init_file safely.
o Added a symbol USE_EXTRACT to inetd.c for muds that do not support the
  a[n..] indexing notation.
o Added compatability for to_int(), to_string, copy_mapping() and send_imp()
  efuns in the form of definitions in inetd.c
o Added SYSTEM field to hold system information.
o Moved timeout notification to reply.c module.
o Added HOST_STATUS field to "hosts" queries in udp/query.c
o Added PACKET_LOSS diagnostic field which holds the number of packets lost
  before the last reply (or timeout) arrived.
o Auto-updating of host and port numbers:
    The memory-resident host list is updated and a log recorded of the event.
    No change is made to the INETD_HOSTS file.
o Illegal calls of receive_udp() are logged.
o Checking for illegal characters is done when encoding packets.
o "time" queries changed to return ctime(time()) in udp/query.c
o Renamed the "CHANNEL" and "CMD" headers used by udp/channel.c to "channel"
  and "cmd" so as to reserve upper case for standard headers in udp.h. See
  udp/channel.c for backwards compatability hack.
o Ftp module added. (udp/ftp.c)
o Improved error tracing (slightly) when remote commands fail.
o The DATA field will be encoded as long as it is present in the data mapping
  even if it's contents is (int)0 to ensure the mapping indices are correct
  on decoding.
o Changed udp/reply.c so replies will be sent to players with tell_object() if
  the players name is used as the SENDER field, but to player->udp_reply() if
  the filename of the player is used.
o start_up() is only called in inetd.c at boot-up (ie. !this_player()) to
  make it a bit nicer when testing/debugging.
o Added locate module. (udp/locate.c)

Version 0.61:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
o Fixed a bug(/feature?) in packet decoding that was converting some system
  fields to lower case.
