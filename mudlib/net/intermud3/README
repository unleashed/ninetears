The Intermud3 package, Discworld-style variant.

This package was born on Nightmare mud and was originally written by
Descartes (as far as I know).  After that, it took a trip to Discworld,
where Turrican made some modifications.  Thereafter, it went to 
Final Realms where perhaps a couple tweaks were done.  Donky made some
very useful changes to it when it got to WWC.

Extensive changes were done by Hamlet of WWC.  Hamlet also added the
config file (intermud_cfg.h) which now makes it possible to do a lot
of the setup of the package without altering any actual source.

Obviously, since each DW-style lib is just a bit different, and, in
particular, the way channels are handled is very different from lib
to lib, changes will have to be made to get this package operational.

The package REALLY wants to live at /net/intermud3/.  This should be
a viable place on at least most DW-style muds.  If you desire to move
it, you're in for some minor source alterations (mostly the #include 
lines).

In particular, eventReceiveChannelMessage() and eventReceiveChannelEmote()
in services/channel.c will need modification of their last lines in order
to pass the message along to the proper handler.

cmds/ has some samples of how to call the code from your mudlib.  Actual
installation of such modifications is left as an exercize to the viewer :P
